         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Certainly it is the property of every image whatſoever, to ſet forth the like forme and figure, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be thought worthy the name of an image, unleſſe it be as like as it may be to that body that it ought to repreſent. Let us take for example of what we ſay, a loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-glaſſe in this, an image cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare unleſſe it draw a ſimilitude or like form from elſewhere, and as I may ſo ſay, conceive it, then alſo by how much purer and clearer the glaſſe is, ſo much the more evidently doth the image of God appear in it. In like manner, the more clearer and pure the mans ſoule is, ſo much the clearer doth the divine Image ſhew forth it ſelfe. And
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65322:14"/> therefore to this end our great God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man altogether pure, without blemiſh or ſpot, indued with faculties of ſoul and body, blameleſſe &amp; unreproveable, that the image of God might be ſeen in him, and not ſo as in a glaſſe a vain and liveleſſe ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow appeareth, but a true and a living I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and likeneſſe, or ſimilitude of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible God, and of his inward hidden immenſe beauty; I ſay, an Image of the divine wiſedome, the underſtanding of man, of long ſuffering, goodneſſe, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and patience of God in the ſpirit of man, of love and mercy in the affections of the heart, of juſtice, ſanctity, ſincerity, and purity in the will, of lowlineſſe, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſſe, humanity and vertue in all his actions and words, of power in his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and rule over the earth, and fear of <note place="margin">The true uſe of the image of God.</note> all living creatures granted unto him: laſt of all, of eternity in the immortalitie of the ſoule. Moreover, out of this Image man ſhould or ought firſt of all, know God, and then himſelfe; I ſay, God his Creator to be all things, the chiefe and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being, of whom all other created things have their being, and all thoſe eſſentially,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65322:14"/> whoſe image ſhould ſhine in man.

And thereupon it is, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain man thinking Chriſt to be onely man, and therefore ſaying, <hi>Good maſter, what good ſhall I doe that I may have eternall life?</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is made, <hi>What doeſt thou call me good? None is good but onely God alone,</hi> that is to ſay, eſſentially; and but for, and without God, no good can be. Yet further is to be noted, that man out of this Image, ſhould learn to know himſelfe, to wit, that there <note place="margin">The I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent nothing but God.</note> is a very great difference between him and God, and man not God himſelfe, but his Image, ſimilitude, likeneſſe, or proportion, in whom God alone ſhould be ſeen. And therefore beſides God, nothing ſhould live, appeare, work, will, love, think, ſpeak, and rejoyce in man; but if any thing elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65322:15"/> God ſhould move and work in him, then the man cannot be the Image of God, but his, contrariwiſe, by whom he is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, driven, and carried away. And to ſpeak briefly, the man ought to ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wholly to be delivered up, devoted, &amp; reſigned up to God, fulfilling the divine <note place="margin">God wil be all things in man.</note> will by a paſſive manner, by denying his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

In briefe, nought ſhould be in man, live and work in him, but God alone, wherein conſiſteth the chief innocency, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and holineſſe of man: for what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">The chiefe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity.</note> innocency can be thought upon, then that the man ſhould not do his own proper will, but to ſuffer God in him to work, and

               <p>REgeneration is the work of the holy Ghoſt, by which the man, the ſonne of wrath and eternall condemnation, is made the ſonne of grace and ſalvation, and of a ſinner a juſt man, through Faith, the Word, and the Sacraments, by which our hearts, both ſenſe, mind, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will and affections, are renewed, illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65322:21"/> and ſanctified in Chriſt, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſt, unto a new creature.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65322:22"/> let us ſee how we are regenerated by Chriſt: Even as the old birth is propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted carnally from <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo regeneration is made ſpiritually from Chriſt, through the word of God, which is like unto a ſeed of a new creature, <hi>born</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter, Epiſt.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.) <hi>not of a corruptible ſeed, but of incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, by the word of God, living and remaining for evermore.</hi> And bleſed <hi>John, Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>For he begot us voluntarily by the word of his faith, tbat we might be a certain beginning of his creatures.</hi> Therefore this Word produceth Faith, which apprehendeth in like manner the Word, and in that Jeſus Chriſt, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the holy Ghoſt, and by that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, force, and efficacie, the man is rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated. Briefly, regeneration is made firſt by the holy Ghoſt, <hi>John</hi> 3. and this doth Chriſt call, or term, <hi>to be born of the Spirit.</hi> Secondly, by faith, <hi>John</hi> 5. <hi>He that beleeveth Jeſus to be Chriſt, is born of God.</hi> Thirdly, by Baptiſme, <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>

                  <hi>enter into the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> Of which things let us ſee further: By <hi>Adam</hi> the man came by the greateſt and chiefeſt of evils, ſinne, abomination, wrath, death, devill,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65322:22"/> hell and damnation: for theſe are the fruits of the old deſcent, and originall: but in Chriſt the man recovereth, and receiveth the chiefeſt good, as juſtice, grace, bleſſing, <note place="margin">The fruits of both births.</note> life, and eternall ſalvation.

From <hi>Adam</hi> the man hath an arrogant ſpirit, ſwelling and proud, who if he have a deſire to be regenerate, and born again, and to be renewed, then it will be neceſſary for him to receive an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirit, plain and ſimple from Chriſt by <note place="margin">A new ſpirit from Chriſt.</note> faith. From <hi>Adam</hi> we receive an unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpirit, blaſphemous and ungratefull; therefore it behoveth us by faith in Chriſt, to attain to a beleeving ſpirit, faithfull, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, and well pleaſing unto God. From <hi>Adam</hi> a diſobedient, fierce, and raſh ſpirit is given unto us: from Chriſt we muſt take the ſpirit of obedience, meekneſſe and modeſty, through faith in Chriſt.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65322:23"/> From <hi>Adam</hi> we poſſeſſe the ſpirit of wrath, hoſtility, revenge, and homicide; but from Chriſt, by faith in the place thereof, is to be gotten the ſpirit of long-ſuffering, love of man, and goodneſſe it ſelfe, which is charity. From <hi>Adam</hi> by our nativity, and carnal off-ſpring, the man hath a covetous heart, and ſpirit churliſh, ſeeking one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his owne commodities and profits, ſnatching, and catching, that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mans; but from Chriſt by faith, is to be obtained the ſpirit of mercy, piety, and liberality. From <hi>Adam</hi> by carnall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation doth proceed the ſpirit of ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe, uncleanneſſe, and intemperance; againſt which it is meet to ſeek to obtain a chaſte ſpirit, clean and temperate. From <hi>Adam</hi> is communicated to him a lying ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſpeaking nothing but falſeneſſe and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniation: from Chriſt we ought to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate the ſpirit of truth, integrity and conſtancy. Laſt of all, from <hi>Adam</hi> doth <note place="margin">From Adam all evill, from Chriſt all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> paſſe the ſpirit of beaſts terrene or earthly, and meere brutiſh: and contrariwiſe, there is to be conceived from Chriſt, a ſpirit from heaven, celeſtiall and divine: and for that cauſe it was behoovefull for Chriſt to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65322:23"/> take humanity upon him, to be conceived by the holy Ghoſt, and to abound with the ſame ſpirit above meaſure; yea, for this cauſe it was convenient that the Spirit of the Lord, the Spirit of wiſdome and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the Spirit of counſell and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the Spirit of knowledge and the feare of God ſhould reſt upon him, as ſaith <hi>Iſaias, Chap.</hi> 11. that the humane nature in him <note place="margin">The hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt and his Spirit.</note> and by him, ſhould be renewed, and that we in him, and by him, and through him ſhould become a new off-ſpring and a new creature, receiving from him the ſpirit of wiſdome and underſtanding for the ſpirit of fooliſhneſſe; the ſpirit of knowledge in room of our naturall and inbred blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; the ſpirit of the feare of the Lord, in ſtead of the ſpirit of impiety: in which permutation conſiſteth the new life, &amp; the fruit of the new creature, or regeneration. For as in <hi>Adam</hi> we were all ſpiritually dead. neither could we expect other then death and works of darkneſſe it ſelfe, in Chriſt <note place="margin">In Chriſt by faith we are reſtored to life again.</note> we muſt be raiſed again to the workes of light. As by carnall generation we entred into the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo by faith through Chriſt, we muſt attain unto righteouſneſſe.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65322:24"/> As by the fleſh of <hi>Adam,</hi> pride, covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, luſt, and all kind of uncleanneſſe is begotten, born, and groweth old in us; ſo by the holy Spirit our nature ought to be renewed, ſanctified, and repurged from all pride, covetouſneſſe, luſt, and envie. And it is needful that we from Chriſt ſhould draw a new ſpirit, a new heart, ſenſe and minde, in the ſame manner as we drew from <hi>Adam</hi> our fleſhly ſubject to ſinne.

                  <hi>Father is eternall.</hi> After this manner then are we renewed in Chriſt to life eternall, regenerated by Chriſt, and in Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a new creature: by this regeneration by Chriſt, and the holy Ghoſt, and Faith, it is neceſſary works muſt flow and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, which we deſire we ſhould pleaſe God in, ſo we live in the new birth, and the new birth doth live in us, ſo we in Chriſt, and Chriſt in us: ſo laſt of all, we live in the <note place="margin">The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the new birth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the fruits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thereof.</note> Spirit of Chriſt, and the Spirit of Chriſt in us.

And by this appeareth, how by the incarnation and humanity of Chriſt, regeneration is raiſed, or proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; that is to wit, becauſe man out of his ambition, pride, and diſobedience, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and turned himſelf from God: this Apoſtaſie could not be amended, or put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but by extream humility, lowlineſſe of will, and obedience of the Sonne of God. And as Chriſt in his converſation upon earth among men, was moſt humble, it is neceſſary that he ſhould be the ſame in thee, to live in thee, and to renue the Image of God in thee. See now and behold the moſt amiable, the moſt lowly, curteous, the moſt <note place="margin">The life of Chriſt in us. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt is the rule of our life.</note> obedient, and moſt patient Chriſt, and learn of him, or even as he is, live in him. For what was the cauſe, ſayeſt thou, why he ſo lived? Truly, that he might be thy example, looking-glaſſe, and rule of life. He (I ſay) and no St. <hi>Bennets</hi> rule, nor of any other man commended unto thee, but the example of Chriſt, I ſay of Chriſt,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65322:25"/> which his Apoſtles with one conſent and direct finger did alone point at. And this is the reaſon of his paſſion, death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; that is to ſay, that thou with <note place="margin">The new life is the fruit of the death &amp; paſſion of our Lord.</note> him mayſt die from thy ſinnes, and again in him, with him, and by him, mayſt riſe ſpiritually, &amp; walk in a new life; of which argument thou mayſt ſee more hereafter in the 11. and 31. Chapters: therefore our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation ariſeth out of, and diſperſeth it ſelfe, from the healthfull fountain of the paſſion, death, and reſurrection of Chriſt: whereupon S. <hi>Peter</hi> (1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1.) ſaith, <hi>God hath regenerated us to a lively hope, through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt:</hi> and thereupon it commeth to paſſe, that the Apoſtles every where do lay the foundation of penitence and the new life, to be the paſſion of Chriſt, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>Spend your time in reverent fear, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that you are not redeemed with corruptible gold or ſilver, but with the pretious bloud, even the Lamb the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Where thou ſeeſt the moſt pretious ranſom of our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be the cauſe of our holy converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The ſame <hi>Peter (Epiſt.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3.) wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, <hi>Chriſt bought our ſinnes in his body upon the Croſſe, that being dead unto ſinne, we might</hi>

                  <hi>live unto righteouſneſſe, by whoſe ſtripes we are healed.</hi> And Chriſt himſelfe <hi>(Luke</hi> 24.) ſaith: <hi>So it behooved Chriſt to ſuffer and riſe again from the dead the third day, and preach repentance and remiſſion of ſinnes in his name.</hi> By which words it is manifeſt, that from the fountain of the paſſion, death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt, doth flow both prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and repentance. Therefore the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt is both ſatisfaction for our ſinnes, and the renewing of man by faith, both which together, and at once, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the redemption and reparation of mankind, becauſe this is the fruit, and this is the efficacie of the paſſion of Chriſt, working in us renovation and ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. This laſtly, is the means whereby we are born again, and renewed in Chriſt; neither is the <hi>laver of regneration</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other thing wherein we are dipt to the death of Chriſt, to wit, to die with Chriſt from our ſinnes, by the help and efficacy of his death, and ariſe from ſin by the grace of his glorious reſurrection.</p>

               <p>REpentance and true converſion is the work of the holy Ghoſt, through which the man acknowledging his faults by the Law, and together therewith the moſt juſt wrath of God againſt ſin, doth earneſtly grieve for the ſame, and would not have committed thoſe things he hath done: and through the Goſpel underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the grace of God by faith in Chriſt, obtaineth the remiſſion of his ſins; and by this penitency, the mortification and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying <note place="margin">The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> of the fleſh, and all carnall pleaſures and concupiſcences of the heart, is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, and together with the ſame quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſpirit, whereby it followeth, that <hi>Adam</hi> with all his corruptions, dieth
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65322:26"/> in us, and Chriſt contrarily liveth in us by faith, becauſe theſe two neceſlarily do grow together; ſo as the reſurrection or renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſpirit, doth follow the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <note place="margin">The old mans death is the life of the new</note> of the fleſh at the heeles; and the quickning of the new ſpirit followeth the aboliſhing of the old man: although the outward man decay, yet the inward man is renewed daily, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>Mortifie your earthly members.

                  <hi>Jeſus our Lord, Rom.</hi> 6. But let us conſider why the fleſh is to be mortified by true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: We ſaid even now, by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> that the man became even devilliſh, earthy, carnall, without God, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out love, that is, without God and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, changed from divine love to worldly love, ſo that every where in all things, he ſtudies himſelfe, favours, counſels, applauds himſelfe, and ſetteth forth and provideth for his own honour and glory. And this as I ſay, is the effect of the fall of <hi>Adam:</hi> whiles hee ſtudieth to make himſelfe God, he involved all mankind, in one and the ſelfe-ſame calamity. And this corruption and depravation of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65322:27"/> muſt be changed and amended by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious repentance, that is to ſay, by true and divine contrition, by faith apprehending the remiſſion of ſins, and by the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">True peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the heart.</note> of carnall pleaſures, ſelf-love, and pride: Neither doth true repentance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, that you put away the great and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſins, but that you deſcend into your ſelfe, and look inward, into the inward of thy heart and mind, turn over the ſecrets and cloſets therof, change and renew them, and convert thy ſelfe from ſelfe-love to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love, from the world and all worldly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiſcences, to a ſpiritual &amp; heavenly life, and participating the merits of Chriſt by faith; whereupon it followeth that a man muſt deny himſelf, as it is <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. that is, to <note place="margin">The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is to die to the world &amp; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</note> tame his will, &amp; ſuffer himſelf to be carried wholly by the divine will, not to love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to account himſelfe the unworthieſt of all mortall creatures, to renounce all things he hath, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. that is, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the world, with all the pomps and honours thereof, to paſſe by his own wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and all endowments or gifts of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">To hate ones own life.</note> with cloſed eyes, to truſt in no creature but God alone, even to hate his own life,

This, this, I ſay, is true repentance and mortifying of the fleſh, without which no man can be the diſciple of Chriſt: this is the true converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the world, from himſelfe and the Devill, to God; without which, no ſinner can have remiſſion of ſins, nor attain ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. This penitence and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is the deniall of himſelfe, and the true croſſe and yoak of Chriſt, of whom himſelf ſpeaketh, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. <hi>Take up my yoak upon</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The yoak of Chriſt is eaſie to the ſpirit, to the fleſh a croſſe.</note> 
                  <hi>you, and learn of me, for I am meeke and lowly in heart.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, by earneſt and inward humility is thy ſelfe-love and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to be tamed; and by curteſie wrath &amp; deſire of revenge, is to be kept under: that which indeed to the new man is an eaſie yoak, and light burthen, howſoever to the fleſh it ſeem a moſt heavie and bitter croſſe.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65322:28"/> And this is indeed to crucifie ones fleſh, <note place="margin">The true croſſe of Chriſt what it is.</note> with the vice and concupiſcence thereof, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. Therefore they erre, and doe greatly erre, which know no other croſſe then tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, and worldly afflictions, being ignorant of inward repentance and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the fleſh to be that true croſſe, which we ought to carry after Chriſt dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in bearing our enemies with great pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and in overcomming the diſdain and arrogancy of our ſlanderers and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries with mildneſſe and humility, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the pattern and example of Chriſt, who was willing to die to the world and all worldlineſſe, moſt perfectly; (I ſay) this <note place="margin">What it is to die to the world.</note> yoak of Chriſt is our true croſſe, which we are bound to beare; which when we doe, then we die to the true world: and not if we hide our ſelves in Monaſteries; and if wee make ſingular orders and rules of living, being in the mean time inorderly in the heart, full of the love of the world, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall pride, phariſaical contempt of others, luſt, envy, and ſecret hatred. I ſay, this is not to die to the world, no it is not; but to mortifie the fleſh, with all things which are pleaſant to it, and daily within, and ſecretly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65322:28"/> to be ſory, and to turn himſelfe from the world inwardly to God, [whereby it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but come to paſſe, that the outward life and manners be renewed and changed; what if now one ſhould only doe outward repentance or penance, abſtaining from great and enormous offences for the feare of puniſhment, and the inward man doe keep his old ſpots ſtill?] and daily inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in heart to die to the world, and to live to Chriſt by faith in ſincere humility, and lowlineſſe: and laſtly, to confide in the grace of God in Chriſt Jeſus, alwayes doing ſuch and ſo great things. To this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance are we called by Chriſt: I ſay, that true and inward converſion from the <note place="margin">With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance Chriſt profits nothing</note> world to God, to whom alſo alone the imputation of his juſtice, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and obedience, through the efficacie of faith, together with the remiſſion of our ſinnes is promiſed; ſo that without this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward repentance, Chriſt profiteth man nothing, that is, he ſhall not participate of his grace, and favour, and merit. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <note place="margin">The fruits of the death &amp; paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt.</note> is, becauſe they are to be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a contrite heart, faithfull, humble, penitent. Truly this fruit of the paſſion of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65322:29"/> Chriſt is in us, that we may die to ſinne by true repentance; and of his reſurrection, in that Chriſt in us, and we in Chriſt, might live: And hereby commeth the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">True re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce inward.</note> in Chriſt, and regeneration, which onely is available with God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. <hi>Vide infra, Chapt.</hi> 33. Therefore let us learn the nature &amp; conſtitution of true repentance, and let us not erre in the common errour, but let all of us eſteem and beleeve to bid adieu to externall idolatry, blaſphemy, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide, adultery, whore-hunting, thefts, with all ſuch enormities and vices exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, to be the true and onely repentance: neither yet doe I deny that this externall repentance is forbidden by the Prophet, as <hi>Eſay</hi> 55. and <hi>Ezek. Chap.</hi> 18. and 33. who likewiſe with the Apoſtles moſt certainly doe command and give charge to levell at the inwards and heart it ſelf, even another repentance inward, more noble then the outward, even that whereby the man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to pride, covetouſneſſe, and luſt, deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and hateth himſelfe, renounceth the world, deſpoyleth himſelfe of all his own, committeth himſelfe to God, crucifieth the fleſh, offereth a daily contrite heart, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65322:29"/> and trembling, as the beſt and well-pleaſing ſacrifice unto God. And laſt of all, doth live with a heart full of tears and groanes; which Character of inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, the Pſalmes of <hi>David</hi> doe every where ſet forth: So it remaineth that this is the true repentance, when inwardly in the heart with earneſt ſorrow, and moſt aſſured feeling of heavineſſe, we be made contrite and afflicted; and again be made holy and joyfull, purged and changed, and amended by remiſſion of ſinnes by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, whereby it cannot but come to paſſe, that the outward life and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners be renewed and changed. What if now one ſhould onely doe outward penance or repentance, abſtain from great and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous offences for the feare of puniſhment, and the inward man doe keep his old ſpots ſtill, and take no care to enter into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and new life in Chriſt, ſhall not ſuch a one nevertheleſſe be damned? neither ſhall it profit him a ſtraw to cry, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> but he ſhall be conſtrained to hear that terrible voice, <hi>I know you not:</hi> For certain and ſure it is, not all that ſay, <hi>Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdome of heaven, but onely thoſe</hi>

               <p>FAith is a ſolid truſt, and a firm and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nain perſwaſion of the grace of God promiſed in Chriſt for the remiſſion of ſinnes and life eternal, kindled through the word of God, and the holy Ghoſt in our hearts: by this faith is conferred unto us the remiſſion of our ſinnes, and that <hi>gratis,</hi> or freely, for no merits of ours, but Chriſts alone; and that of meere grace, that our faith may remain fixed, or <hi>unmoveable,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a firme and ſolid foundation. And this
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65322:30"/> abſolution or forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes, is our juſtice or juſtification, and that true, ſolid, and eternall, before God: For neither is it of Angels, but by the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Sonne of God, his merits and ranſome, which by faith we appropriate unto us, fixing and applying the ſame to our ſelves; therefore neither is the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections <note place="margin">Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a true faith.</note> of our life, or any ſinnes left re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining to withſtand us, but they be cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the vaile of grace, for Chriſts ſake, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. Furthermore, by this ſolid and firm truſt, this followeth, that the man doth dedicate his whole heart ſolely to God, in him he reſteth alone, to this one is he glewed or faſtened, with this alone he entreth ſociety, and is joyned to God, and participateth all things that are of God, and Chriſt, and is made one ſpirit with God, taketh and collecteth from him power and ſtrength, a new life, new joyes, many recreations, peace, lightneſſe of heart, the ſoules Sabbath and reſt.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65322:32"/> I think ſo indeed, but he muſt firſt bee raiſed from death: ſo thou likewiſe that art dead in ſinne to God, canſt not performe any work to God; unleſſe thou be firſt rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Chriſt to life: which being granted, it followeth, thy juſtification onely procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from faith in Chriſt: And faith is like <note place="margin">But in Chriſt.</note> a new-born babe, newly come into the world, weake and naked, ſet before the eyes of his Saviour, from whom, as from his parent, hee receiveth juſtice, honeſty, holineſſe, grace, and the holy Ghoſt. And after this manner is the naked child, by the mercy of God cloathed, and both his bracelets being taken away, he receiveth of God grace, health and holineſſe: This alone therefore, this only receiving, maketh him godly, holy, and happy, and our true juſtification, onely through faith, and not <note place="margin">What our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is.</note> through works: I ſay, by faith, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending Chriſt, be it what it may be, with all his goodneſſe, he challengeth and maketh it his own properly, then of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ſinne, death, Devill, and hell, muſt <note place="margin">Sin and death, &amp; hell are ſubiect to faith</note> give back and vaniſh away: and ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, lively, and effectually doth the merit of Chriſt through faith work and abound,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65322:33"/> that even the ſinnes of the whole world cannot hurt them. Now ſeeing that Chriſt by faith liveth and dwelleth in thee, let us never think or beleeve, that this his habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a dead work, but rather a certain li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thing, not idle; powerfull working, or as I may ſay in one word, a renewing: for faith performeth two things; firſt, it tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planteth thee into Chriſt, and giveth him freely unto thee, with all that he hath: ſecondly, it reneweth thee in Chriſt, that thou mayſt grow green and flouriſh, and live in him: neither is the graffe brought into the ſtock for other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but that it ſhould flouriſh and bring forth fruit in it. And even as by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie of <hi>Adam,</hi> and by the deceit and ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the Devill, the ſeed of the Serpent, and the Diabolicall corruption of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is ſown in man, growing up into a tree bearing the fruits of death; ſo by the word of God, and the holy Ghoſt, the faith is ſown in our hearts, as the ſeed of <note place="margin">Faith is the ſeed of God.</note> God, in which after a wonderfull manner, are ſhut up all divine vertues and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; from whence in a like manner doth flow forth a moſt glorious and new Image
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65322:33"/> of God, and bringeth forth a new tree, whoſe fruits are obedience and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, humility, courteſie, peace, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, juſtice, a new and another man; and ſo the whole Kingdome of God: for true and ſaving faith reneweth the whole man, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth clean the heart, joyneth and uniteth it to God, purged anew, and ſet free from earthly things, it hungreth and thirſteth after righteouſneſſe, it worketh love, it bringeth peace, joy, patience, ſtrength, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in adverſity, it overcommeth the world, it maketh us the ſonnes of God, and heirs of all celeſtiall goodneſſe, and co-heirs with Chriſt. If it happen any to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, or to be ignorant of this joy which is by faith, acknowledging himſelfe to be of little faith, let him beware he diſtruſt not therefore, but rather let him truſt in grace <note place="margin">Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of thoſe that have little Faith.</note> promiſed by Chriſt; which promiſe remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth certain, immoveable, and everlaſting. And although we through humane infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, doe often fall and goe backwards, let us in the mean while alwayes account it ſure and certain, that the grace of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth ſolid and firm, whenſoever by true and ſerious repentance we ariſe from our
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65322:34"/> fall; for Chriſt is and will be Chriſt and Saviour, although you take hold of him by a firm or weak faith, for he imbraceth both alike, and Chriſt is alike to all. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the promiſe of grace is univerſall and perpetuall, upon which it is neceſſary our faith be founded, without difference, firme or weak, and in the mean time erect and fill thy heart with hope, God will in his good time, &amp; in his own ſeaſon, bring that ſincere and ſenſible joy unto thee, although he hide himſelfe a while in the inwards of thy heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 77.

Let us ſhew it in the example of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> whoſe natures,

Neither is there other reaſon in common ſenſe: for by the food from heaven the corruption of the fleſh is to be drowned and waſhed; but juſt and faithfull <hi>Noe</hi> is to be preſerved in the Ark, and a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is to be made between thee and thy great God. Moreover, the Tower of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> or <hi>Confuſion,</hi> ought not to be built in thee. Thou muſt, with <hi>Abraham,</hi> goe forth of thine own Countrey, or knowledge, and all things are to be left, even thy life it ſelfe, that thou mayſt walk perfectly before God, carry out the victory, and goe into the land of promiſe, and Kingdome of God. And Chriſt meaneth no other thing <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. <hi>If any come unto me, and</hi>

Briefly, our great God hath compoſed all the holy Scriptures for faith and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſake: And it all ought to be fulfilled in thee ſpiritually. And to this belongeth all the warres and battels of <hi>Iſrael</hi> againſt the <note place="margin">The type of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by faith.</note> Infidels and Heathen people. And no other thing covered under the bark of the letter and the hiſtory, then the continuall ſtrife between the fleſh and the ſpirit. Of this place and to this purpoſe is whatſoever is extant of the <hi>Moſaicall</hi> Prieſthood, the Tabernacle, the Ark of Covenant and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory: all which doe pertain unto thee to whom it belongeth to pray in faith and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65322:36"/> ſpirit, to burn incenſe, and to kill the Sin-offering, Chriſt Jeſus will have all theſe to be done and performed in thee, who hath contracted theſe in the new Man and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as an epitome and words abbreviated, to be fulfilled in thee by faith, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in one ſigh: for the man is a brevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all natures, is the Center and little world; ſo is it a compendium of the ſacred <note place="margin">All the new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament is to be fulfilled in man.</note> Scripiure, and abridgement of the Word. And to come to the new Teſtament, what other thing is it according to the letter, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an externall teſtimony and pattern, becauſe all things in like maner are to be iterated &amp; fulfilled by faith in man? I ſay all, even all the new teſtament, ſo much as it is, ought to be in us, &amp; this one thing it doth require &amp; look for at our hands, becauſe the kingdom of God is in us: Therfore even as Chriſt by the holy Ghoſt in the faith of <hi>Mary,</hi> was conceived and brought forth; ſo ought the Sonne in me likewiſe be conceived after a ſpirituall manner, and begotten, increaſe, and grow up. Furthermore, becauſe I am become a new creature in Chriſt, it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <note place="margin">The life of Chriſt in us.</note> and it followeth, that I ſhould live and walk in it, in it and with it to flie into
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65322:36"/> exile, with it to exerciſe humility, contempt of the world, patience, loving kindneſſe, and charity, and to pardon or forgive our enemies their injuries, to uſe mercy, to love our enemies, to doe the will of the Father, being tempted of Satan to carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the victory from him, by reaſon of the truth that is in me, derided, deſpiſed, and contemned; and if neceſſity require, to die for, and with him after the example of all the Saints, to beare witneſſe before him, and all the elect, that he is in me, and I in him was joyned by faith, and ſo lived. And this is that which is ſpoken, ſaying, To be conformed to the image of Chriſt; for example, to be born with and in Chriſt, to <note place="margin">The death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt in us.</note> put on Chriſt, to grow up and wax ſtrong in him, to live in exile, to be dipped in his baptiſme, with him to be derided, to die together, and to be crucified together, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe together from the dead, and reigne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and not that alone by the croſſe, and patience, and ſuffering adverſity together; but by daily repentance, and inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and griefe for his ſinnes committed: I ſay, after this manner to die daily with Chriſt, and by crucifying our fleſh, if we
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65322:37"/> be minded to be joined w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> him as with our <note place="margin">Chriſt ought to be in us.</note> head, and to be united therewith: if it be otherwiſe done, then is it not in thee, but without thee, far from faith, heart, &amp; ſpirit, otherwiſe it will profit thee nothing; for he would have thee to be inwardly retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo to live, to bee inwardly conſolated <note place="margin">All things ought to be fulfilled in faith.</note> and kept ſafe. All which faith in Chriſt performed, whilſt the word of God doth live within us, and it is as it were a living witneſſe in us of thoſe things which are ſpoken of in the holy Scripture. And after this manner faith is called <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> or a <hi>Subſtance, Heb.</hi> 11. And out of this which we have ſaid, it doth appeare manifeſtly, all the Sermons and Epiſtles of Chriſt, the Prophets and the Apoſtles, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſo generall, doe belong to one man, <note place="margin">The whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to man.</note> yea to us all, with all the Parables and Miracles the hiſtory of Chriſt is repleniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; therefore neither was it neceſſary thoſe things ſhould be appointed &amp; to come to paſſe written to the knowledge of all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, unleſſe they were ſpiritually in us to be fulfilled. Therfore when I read that Chriſt cured others, I doe promiſe to my ſelf the ſame, becauſe we live one with another:
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65322:37"/> when he cured the blind, I am in good hope that he will give unto me, being ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually blinded, by his grace and bleſſing, a ſpirituall ſight, I mean other miracles, ſeeing there is the ſame reaſon of all, and then being blind, lame, palſie, leprous, and dead in ſinne, doe thou underſtand it by <note place="margin">The let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by faith is to be fulfilled.</note> thy ſelfe, acknowledge it, and confeſſe, and he will make thee whole in him, that thou maiſt have part in the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: the ſumme is, the Scripture doth bear witnes outwardly to thoſe things which inwardly by faith the man ſhould fulfill: So it painteth out the image of God outwardly, according to which inwardly within thee by faith thou oughteſt to be ſo. So is the Kingdome of God according to the letter, Chriſt according to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as ſpeaketh the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 5. So <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> his apoſtaſie and redemption, the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> regeneration; finally, another creature; he deſcribeth outwardly all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee by faith; yea thou thy ſelfe ought to be ſo, or the Scripture profiteth thee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And thus much of faith, &amp; the work of it in us, yea of God himſelfe, and the reigne of Chriſt in our heart.</p>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65322:43"/> the weake. And none is ſpiritually ſicke, who is not penitent, and who is not ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull from his heart for his ſinnes, who hath not a contrite heart and humble, who is ſecure as concerning the wrath of God, who hath not reſolved, and firmly in his mind decreed to flye all worldly concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence; who laſtly, ſeeking after honour, wealth, and pleaſure, takes no knowledge of his ſinnes, ſuch as are ſo, thoſe are not ſick, and conſequently need no Phyſitian, and Chriſt profiteth them nothing, it is manifeſt. Therefore again and again, let this be remembred, that Chriſt called ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but it was to repentance, becauſe a penitent heart, contrite, penſive, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, onely and alone is capable of the moſt pretious bloud, death, and merit of Chriſt. I account him happy whoſoever he be, that heareth this holy calling inwardly, and in his heart; I call that a divine ſorrow and anguiſh for ſinnes, which worketh repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance <note place="margin">God work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſorrow.</note> to ſtedfaſt ſalvation, as the words be, 2 Cor. 7. The holy Spirit doth produce this divine ſorrow by the Law, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meditation of the paſſion of the Lord, becauſe it not onely aboundeth with the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65322:43"/> documents of grace, but alſo withall hath in it an earneſt exhortation to repentance, and a moſt terrible glaſſe of the divine wrath. For if we ſeek into the cauſe of his <note place="margin">The Paſſion of Chriſt efficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> moſt bitter death, what elſe can we ſay was the cauſe, but our ſinnes? If you joyn the divine love, out of which he moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly gave his Son for us, as alſo you ſhall have his ſingular example both terrible and wonderfull of his divine juſtice and clemency; which ſeeing they are ſo, who then ſincerely loving Chriſt, can be affected and delighted with ſinne, which he knows Chriſt had with his bloud waſhed and purged? Conſider alſo with me, O man, which art ſubject to pride, and art ſlave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ambition, with what contempt, and how great humility, Chriſt Jeſus ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire our pride and inſolency, think of his poverty, that he might ſatisfie for thy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs; <note place="margin">The fruits of Chriſts paſſion.</note> ſurceaſe at laſt, through God, ſo ſtudiouſly to ſeek after wealth, and inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to thirſt after riches moſt wretchedly.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65322:44"/> doſt give thy ſelfe to pleaſure and luſt, how evill is thy prepoſterouſneſſe, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and wickedneſſe, to take delight and pleaſure in thoſe things which to Chriſt were ſo wonderfully bitter; he died to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate thy wrath, hatred, enmity, rancor, bitterneſſe, deſire of revenge, and implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, with extreame mildneſſe and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and wilt not thou even for the leaſt cauſe, be very angry, and account revenge more pleaſant then life, even for which thy Redeemer did drink the moſt bitter cup of death? wherefore ſo many as aſpire to the name of Chriſtians, and doe not abſtain fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſin, thoſe (I ſay) do even crucifie Chriſt, and doe make a mock of him as it is ſaid <note place="margin">The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent do even crucifie Chriſt.</note> in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, Chap.</hi> 6. Therefore it is unpoſſible that thoſe ſhould participate of the merits of Chriſt, which indeed they doe tread under foot, as it is in the ſame Epiſtle <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. And becauſe they doe pollute the blood of the Teſtament, neither beleeve truly that their ſinnes are expiated by him, or much eſteem his death, or think he died for his cauſe, becauſe they contemne the ſptrit of grace, that is, they deſpiſe it and repell it, even for that they
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65322:44"/> by their wicked life they deride and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne <note place="margin">Chriſt his bloud calleth for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge againſt the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</note> the mighty grace of God offered: ſo that the bloud of Chriſt ſhed for them, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for revenge againſt them, and that by the juſt judgement of God (which is moſt terrible to heare) all which they doe offer up &amp; draw upon themſelves: for truly <hi>it is a fearfull thing to fall into the hands of the living God,</hi> as it is written in the ſame Chapter: for God even our God, is a living God, not a liveleſſe Idoll, that will not, or is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to revenge this refuſall and contempt of his grace: which revenge and divine wrath, even their own conſcience doth threaten them, and follow them at the heeles, who hearing that the Sonne of God did die a moſt terrible death for ſinne, yet doe not take any care to abſtain from ſinne. And this is the cauſe wherefore preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the death of Chriſt, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance <note place="margin">Why God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of all men.</note> was preached over all the world, both becauſe he died the death for the ſinnes of the whole world, and in all places of the world men ſhould repent, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. <hi>Acts,</hi> and that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that <hi>Panacea,</hi> that ſoveraigne hearb that cureth all diſeaſes with a contrite, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent

And yet there be many, who although all their life they never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented ſeriouſly that they had ſinned, nor have abated a hair of their wrath, covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, pride, hatred, envie, hypocriſie, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe; but rather have grown and augmented their ſinnes more and more, and yet dare require remiſſion of their ſins, <note place="margin">The falſe faith of falſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</note> and challenge the merit of Chriſt to belong unto them, which indeed is their blind and deplorable impudencie. Theſe are ſuch as flatter themſelves to their exceeding e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, perſwading themſelves through their own fooliſhneſſe, that they are good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65322:45"/> becauſe for ſooth they know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that Chriſt died for their ſinnes, and by this meanes they doe beleeve ſted faſtly they ſhall be ſaved: but thou art an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, and after a moſt miſerable manner bewitched falſe Chriſtian; for neither doth the word of God teach, that by this means life eternall is to be obtained, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any of the Prophets or Apoſtles did any time ſo preach; but this is the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conſent: Thou which requireſt to have thy ſinnes pardoned, firſt repent, abſt. in from thy ſins; and then grieving from thy heart, &amp; earneſtly, that thou haſt ſinned, beleeve in Chriſt. But how ſhould he bee ſorry for his ſinnes, who never thinketh how to eſchew ſinne? or how ſhould he eſchew his ſinnes which is not ſorrowfull for the committing of them? Wherefore Chriſt with all his Apoſtles &amp; Prophets, doth teach thee that thou muſt <note place="margin">What it is to die to the world.</note> dye to the world and ſinne, as to pride, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, luſt, wrath, hatred, and that thou muſt return with all thy heart to the Lord, and ask pardon of him; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, now thou art abſolved and free from thy ſins, and now the heavenly Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65322:46"/> reſpecteth thee, who onely healeth contrite hearts; if thou inſiſt upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, Chriſt profiteth thee nothing, and in vain, and of no value, or belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſalvation, is the boaſting of thy faith: for true faith, which reneweth the man, it extinguiſheth and mortifieth ſinnes in man, and quickneth him in Chriſt, that is, maketh him to live in Chriſt, in faith, and in his charity, humility, meekneſſe, and patience. And after this manner Chriſt is to thee the way to life, and thou in like manner art a new creature in him. But if thou intend to ſinne, and haſt not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to leave thine iniquity, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaudeſt all thy old ſinnes or actions of old <hi>Adam,</hi> let it be; how canſt thou be another creature, or how canſt thou belong to Chriſt, when thou doſt not <hi>crucifie the fleſh with all the deſires thereof, and concupiſcences?</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. Goe then, and daily heare ten Sermons a day, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <note place="margin">The vaine worſhip of God.</note> month confeſſe thy ſelfe and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate: for all theſe things are farre un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of remiſſion of ſinnes; becauſe a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent heart, contrite and faithfull, which maketh thee capable of this wholſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65322:46"/> thou doſt not bring with thee. Truly and indeed, the Sacraments and Word of God, which are the moſt powerfull reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies &amp; helps, yet but only to thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of their ſins from the bottom of their hearts, and that with daily faithfull mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning doe deteſt the way of their old and former life: For what profiteth it to anoint a ſtone with pretious oyntment, or a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine? Or what harveſt ſhalt thou reap if thou ſoweſt amongſt thornes and briers? Therefore thou muſt firſt pull up all theſe young thornes that choak the good ſeed, and all things that hinder thee from reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Whom Chriſt profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</note> a good harveſt. Laſt of all, whoſoever cleaveth to his ſinnes, it is ſure that Chriſt profiteth him nothing; the nativity of Chriſt helpeth him nothing, who careth not to be born with him; nothing the death of Chriſt, him who hath not determined firmly in his mind to die unto ſin; nothing the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt, him who refuſeth in him to ariſe from ſin: laſtly, the aſcenſion of Chriſt profiteth nothing to him that will not lead a heavenly life.

And for that <note place="margin">Chriſt is the light of our life.</note> cauſe the Sonne of God became Man, and was converſant amongſt men on earth, that he might ſhew unto us a living example of a heavenly life, divine, innocent, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that we might follow him as a light in the dark; for which cauſe he calleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <hi>the Light of the world,</hi> which if we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, we doe not walk in darkneſſe, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth <hi>John, Chap.</hi> 8. Whereby it evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth, that all thoſe doe remain in the darke, and will never attaine to the light of life who doe not follow Chriſt in faith and life. And what this darkneſſe is, St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to lay down the works of darkneſſe, and to put on the Armour of light, as if the <note place="margin">Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call darknes</note> ſhould ſay, Repent. But we have ſufficiently
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65322:52"/> declared before that true and divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, together with true faith, doth utterly change the man, crucifie the fleſh, and impoſe and beget a new way of life through the Holy Ghoſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, leſt wee being ſeduced by error, ſhould believe Chriſtianity to be words only, and not a reality or reall being; and that there ſhould be a living example of the quickened Spirit or new man, God <note place="margin">Chriſt is the ſhape of the new man.</note> ſet before our eyes his own Sonne, not only as a ranſome and Mediatour, but as a glaſſe of true piety, and ſhape of the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or new man, in whom not the fleſhly <hi>Adam</hi> through ſin, but God himſelf did raign, that we might daily be renewed in him, according to his own Image, of which many things remain to be ſpoken. We know every one of us, and find by dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experience, our nature offending; that is to ſay, our blood, our fleſh, body and mind to be polluted with all kinde of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, malice, ſin and wickedneſſe; all which are both the works of the Devill, working powerfully in the carnall and naturall man: <note place="margin">The ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of all ſins.</note> as alſo more eſpecially, the wicked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved will, becauſe the depraved will is the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65322:52"/> root of all ſins, which being taken away, there would be no ſin; for the evill will is it which turneth him from God and his will: for whatſoever differeth from God, or the chief good, that cannot but be evill. And this averſion, or falling away of both, was, I ſay, of the Devill, and the fall of man, and thereby ſin came into the world, which we deliver one unto another by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall propagation; whereby it appeareth, that our fleſh and blood by nature, and off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, doth nouriſh our aptneſſe to evill, and the ſeed of the Devill and our fleſh will be infected with the venime of <hi>Satan,</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed pride is, lying, luſt, and every wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked work condemned of God: And for this inclination ſo wicked, Chriſt calleth the <hi>Phariſees, ſons of the Devill,</hi> Joh. 8. and many other their diſciples, by the name of <hi>Satan;</hi> no otherwiſe then, as if covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, lying, pride, and all wicked concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence were the Devill, wherewith the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and carnall man is infected; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it followeth further, that as many as lead their life without repentance, full of pride, covetouſneſſe, luſt and envie, all thoſe do live in the Devill and do partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65322:53"/> of the inclination and nature of the Devill. In which number all thoſe which take upon them any work, having an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew of integrity, or honeſty of their own inducements, or bringing up, and yet are in their heart and inwardly, full of the Devill, or that the Devill remaineth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, according to the ſaying of Chriſt to the <hi>Jews,</hi> which, although it be a terrible thing to ſpeak, yet it is really ſo, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture; <note place="margin">Our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the chiefeſt good. Why Chriſt was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate.</note> wherefore, ſeeing, as it is confeſſed, our nature is ſo extremely &amp; miſerably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, it is behoofefull without doubt, that it ſhould be corrected and amended, which by no means could be obtained or effected, but by this; that is to wit, that the chief good ſhould deſtroy the chief evill; and that God himſelf ſhould become man. Now then the Son of God became man, not for his own cauſe, but for ours, that he might reconcile us by himſelf unto God, and make us partakers of the ſoveraign good; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purged, ſanctifie us; for what is to be ſanctified, that of neceſſity is to be ſanctified through God &amp; with God; and as God is perſonally in Chriſt, ſo we w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> God by faith muſt be united, that we may live in him,

It is the property of <note place="margin">The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man &amp; the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.</note> the naturall man to ſeek after honours, and hunt after great things: The ſpirituall on the other ſide loved the humility of Chriſt, and deſireth to become nothing; And whereas moſt men do deſire to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or excell others, ſcarce one coveteth to be reputed as nothing, of whom the one belongeth to the ſquare or rule of life of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> the other to the rule of Chriſt.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65322:56"/> thoſe onely wiſe that live after their owne <note place="margin">The falſe &amp; true light.</note> will, delicately and eaſily; not knowing that then he chiefly liveth in the Devill, when moſt fooliſhly he applaudeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and eſteemeth his own life as the beſt and moſt pleaſing, which moſt miſerable men, being faſt bound in the luſt of their own carnall wiſdome, doe inforce others to follow the like errours: contrariwiſe, thoſe whom the true and eternall light hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, thoſe are touched at the heart, when they doe ſee the pomp and diſdaine, pride, pleaſure, wrath, revenge, and ſuch kind of fruit of the carnall life, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them to ſigh from the bottome of their hearts, ſaying; How farre is this from Chriſt and his knowledge, from true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, from genuine Chriſtianity, and laſtly, from the fruits of the new birth of the ſonnes of God? for he liveth yet in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> in the old creature, and in the Devill himſelfe: for to offend boldly, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to ſinne, is nothing elſe then to live in the Devill. In whom therefore the life of Chriſt is not, this man is without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, neither is a true Chriſtian, nor the ſonne of God; nay, Chriſt knoweth him
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65322:56"/> not. He who will rightly know him as a Saviour and example of life, it is meet he know him to be meere love, meere courteſie, patience and humility; which vertues of Chriſt it behoveth thee to have, and love them from the bottome of thy heart, and faſten them to thy ſelf. As a plant by its favour and ſmel that it ſendeth forth, bewrayes its own nature: ſo thou oughteſt to know Chriſt, and by experience be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that he is a certain moſt fragrant <note place="margin">The true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt.</note> ſtock, from whence thy ſoule doth draw and obtain admirable ſtrength and new vitall ſpirits, as alſo ſingular joy and ſolace. And after this manner is taſted how ſweet the Lord is, ſo is the truth known, ſo is the chiefe and eternall good perceived, and then doth he know certainly that nothing is better then the life of Chriſt, nothing more pleaſant, ſweet, pretious, or more full of tranquillity. And laſtly, nothing can be more likened, or be compared to life eternall. And do we doubt that becauſe it is better then all, it ſhould be more deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? for in whom the life of Chriſt is not, this man cannot know what the peace and tranquillity of eternall life is, nor what the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65322:57"/> chiefe good is, nor everlaſting truth, nor what is true peace and joy, the true light, and true charity, ſeeing Chriſt is all theſe himſelfe; whereupon <hi>John Ep.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 4. ſaith, <hi>Every one that loveth, is born of God, and knoweth God; he that loveth not, knoweth not God, becauſe God is love.</hi> Whereby the fruits of the new birth which is of God, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and alſo life and a new creature; not to be words and an externall forme, but a ſubſtance, but the Queen of vertues, and which is God himſelfe, that is to ſay, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: for of whomſoever any is born, it is meet he ſhould have the ſame properties; and he that ſaith he is born of God, let him ſhew that by charity, becauſe God is charity. In like manner, the knowledge of God reſteth not in words, and ſhadowed or vain knowledge, but in lively, amiable, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and moſt ſincere pleaſure, which ought to flow into the bottome of our heart and mind, and there to dwell, when we taſte by faith inwardly in our hearts, the ſweetneſſe of God.

For how much every one dieth to the world, ſo much Chriſt liveth in him. Goe to them, let Chriſt live in thee in time, that thou in like manner maiſt live with him in <note place="margin">From whence be the pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations of the mind.</note> eternity. But ſeeing that the mind diſtracted with divers worldly concupiſcences, is not capable of true tranquillity and peace, it followeth, that thoſe that doe die before

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65322:60"/> ſcope thereof; neither doe I ſpeak here of the great world, and of his exceeding te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of God, and divine love.

A true Chriſtian is moſt unlike to thoſe hypocrites, who in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and adverſity liveth according to piety, equally juſt and faithfull to his Chriſt, and taketh all things indifferently his lot doth caſt upon him.

In example of this, all true Chriſtians are in the world truly, but not of the world; and although they live in it, no part of the love of it cleaveth unto them, accounting it for ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, and as nothing; worldly pomps, dignities, concupiſcence of the eyes and the fleſh, with the pride of life, how the world is dead to them and is crucified, and they <note place="margin">Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count al worldly things but ſhadows</note> to the world, likewiſe are dead and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe they eſteeme little of honours, wealth and pleaſures, and account them as dung to obtain Chriſt, or in reſpect of Chriſt.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65322:64"/> God. For the enmity of this world, is the friendſhip and love of God: And in like manner, the enmity of God is the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the world. Whoſoever therefore would be a friend of the world, is ſure to be the enemy of God, witneſſe <hi>James, chap.</hi> 4. and Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>John</hi> 15. plainly profeſſeth, <hi>If you were of this world, the world would love that which were its own: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are not of the world; for I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen you out of the world, therefore the world doth hate you.</hi> For as the Sea receiveth, and will beare quick men, and caſteth out dead men: ſo the world is adverſary to thoſe that are dead to the world, and ſo eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, and is otherwiſe to thoſe that live in pomp and ſplendor, it commendeth them. Finally, to ſpeak briefly, he who ſo liveth that in his heart pride, covetouſneſſe, pleaſure, wrath, revenge, &amp; the deſire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of mortified, are to him indeed the world <note place="margin">What it is to die to the world.</note> is dead, and he to the world: this man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in Chriſt, and Chriſt in him. And thoſe that are ſo, theſe Chriſt doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge for his, to others it is ſaid, <hi>I know you not,</hi> who in like manner knew him not, and were aſhamed of his life: I ſay, his
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65322:65"/> meekneſſe, humility, and patience. In brief, he who refuſeth to live with Chriſt here in time, how ſhould he live with Chriſt in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity? For how ſhould he live in thee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life, who canſt not live with him in this life? It remaineth therefore, whoſe life in this world is not in Chriſt, he ſhall not have life in the other world. Here I pray thee now examine thy life, and ſee whether it be more like to Chriſts or the <note place="margin">Vnion with Chriſt or the Devill.</note> Devils: Certainly, with one of them thou ſhalt be joyned eternally after death. But who is dead to himſelfe, he is in love with no buſineſſes, yea is dead to the world; what other thing is it to die unto the world, then not to love the world, and the things of this world, according to that of <hi>John, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>He who loveth the world is not of God?</hi> For what ſhould he doe in the world, who inwardly and in his heart is dead to it?

Moreover, the love of the world belongeth to the old man, not to the regeneration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65322:65"/> the world hath nothing but honours, <note place="margin">The old man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in the world, the new man in Chriſt.</note> wealth, concupiſcence of the eyes, and of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And contrariwiſe, to the new man, he hath all things in Chriſt, as joy, honour, wealth and pleaſure: for what can be more <note place="margin">The I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God the great eſt dignity of man.</note> honorable to a man, or is more to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then the Image of God renewed by Chriſt? Or if we ſeek pleaſures, what man in his wits can doubt that God doth give delight to his, above all creatures, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light <note place="margin">The man is made for greater things then this world.</note> them more? as the words of <hi>Taulerus</hi> ſay. Furthermore, what think you of that which the Scripture teacheth, Man was not made for the worlds ſake, but the world for mans ſake, nor to fill his belly with delicate meat, pamper his own wit, heap up riches, ſpread his Empire abroad to get moſt ample poſſeſſions, grounds, and fruits of the earth, to be gorgeouſly atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to abound in gold and ſilver, to be Lord of the earth, to put all his delight and joy therein, as in his paradiſe to place it, and know &amp; hope for nothing but what is before his eyes: Or laſtly, for any ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene cauſe whatſoever, or any thing that is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65322:66"/> fraile, although of it ſelfe it be good, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and pretious. No truly, he muſt goe hence, he is but a tenant and a life-renter of this great world, into which we enter many at one inſtant, as it were by heaps, yet death calls for us alſo. As it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for any of us to carry with us a grain of all the treaſure we have heaped, whereby it evidently appeareth, that we were not created for this temporall life, <note place="margin">To what man was created.</note> neither this world to be the principall end of our creation, ſeeing that we live therein as prilgrims and gueſts, therefore another cauſe brought us into this world, and for whom we were born, which is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and the image of God which we bear in Chriſt, and unto whom we are renewed: In this we are convinced evidently, to wit, that we are eſpecially created for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and life eternall, which Chriſt hath recovered for us, and to whom we are regenerate by the holy Ghoſt. How prepoſterous then is it for one to fix his heart to the world, and give his minde to earthly things, when we know the other to be more noble then the whole word? I ſay, for a man to attend and ſpend his time
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65322:66"/> on earthly things, which is the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of all creatures, which carrieth about him the image of God in Chriſt, and is renewed to this image: Wherefore as I ſaid before, the man for the world was not created, but the world was created for man, and therefore carrleth about with him the image of God in Chriſt: of which the excellency and nobility is ſo great, that all men with all his workes and power, could not repaire one ſoule, or renew the Image of God. But for this cauſe it was neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould die, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the image of God was defaced and deſtroyed in man, it ſhould be renewed by the holy Ghoſt, and he ſhould become forthwith the habitation and houſe of God. And this being known and called to mind, if he be right minded, he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver compare the riches of the world, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours <note place="margin">To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre earthly things before heuven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is great madnes.</note> and pleaſures, with the price of his ſoule, which Chriſt hath redeemed at ſuch a price: for what is it to caſt pearls in the mire and before ſwine, if this ſhould not be? That which our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. pertaineth to this place, <hi>What profiteth it a man to get the whole world, and loſe his owne</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:65322:67"/>

               <p>HE that will hate himſelfe, he muſt firſt, not love himſelfe, ſo that he may dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly die to ſinne, and therefore he muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually <note place="margin">Selfe-love the chiefeſt enemy of the ſoul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; Idolatry</note> wraſtle with himſelfe and his fleſh; for nothing is more hurtfull to a man that is deſirous of his ſalvation, and more hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth him, then ſelfe-love; I ſay that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Philautia,</hi> of which this following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in all this book, is the ſubject. I doe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65322:67"/> not ſay that care of preſerving our ſelves, but loving our ſelves is forbidden: For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God alone is to be loved, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that he who loveth himſelfe, is an Idolater, and maketh himſelfe God; what every one loveth, in that his heart is fixed, neither can we be taken but with the love and ſervitude of ſomething, ſo as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſervants, deſpoiling our ſelves of our proper liberties; and conſequently, having ſo many Lords, we are ſubject unto, as we have objects to love; but if thy love be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and ſimply towards God, then thou art ſubject to no object, but it is manifeſt thou art at liberty; wherefore thou muſt be very circumſpect, that thou follow nothing that may hinder the divine love in thee: And if thou deſireſt to poſſeſſe God alone as much as thou art able, ſo much in like <note place="margin">The law of God brings forth tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, the world pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</note> manner of thy all, muſt thou conſecrate to him: But if thou love thy ſelfe, and pleaſe thy ſelfe, much penſiveneſſe, ſorrow, feare, and ſadneſſe, will befall thee. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if thou love God, and rejoyceſt in him onely, and doſt dedicate thy ſelfe onely to him, then will he be thy comfort, never ſhalt thou be overcome with ſorrow, feare,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65322:68"/> and ſadneſſe; he who ſeeketh himſelfe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, and in all things, and followeth after his own profit onely, praiſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, he never attaineth to tranquillity: for alwayes ſomething meeteth him that bringeth perturbation. Therefore beware you beleeve not, that the increaſe of wealth, fame, and honour, is good and profitable, but rather ſet before thee the beſt things, contemne ſuch things, and extirpate the root of concupiſcence, which hindereth thee in purſuance of the love of God. Now ſeeing the commodities of this <note place="margin">True &amp; conſtant reſt in God.</note> life, praiſe, honour, and likewiſe the world it ſelfe, are fraile and floating away, but the love of God remaineth for ever: that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light cannot be durable which thou takeſt in the love of thy ſelfe and earthly things, becauſe it may vary by very light occaſion, where contrariwiſe the mind firmly ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on divine love, cannot but continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce: vain, frail, and brickle is that which is not grounded upon God; but doe thou forſake all things, and thou ſhalt finde all things by faith: For the lover of himſelfe and the world, findeth not God. The love <note place="margin">Who findeth not God</note> of our ſelves is earthly, and not of God,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65322:68"/> and is chiefe enemy to heavenly wiſdome: <note place="margin">Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> for it careth nothing leſſe then to be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the world, and to be accounted great; for which cauſe, and for their own profit and ſimplicity, it cometh to paſſe, as almoſt with one blot it is put out of the mind and memory of Man. Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many in Sermons doe boaſt and make a noyſe thereof, yet remaineth, and will remain, this pretious Pearle unknown and hidden, as long as in life and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners we are farre from it, and know little: And the onely way to find it, is to unlearn and forget humane wiſdome, proper ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, ſelfe-love. And for humane and earthly wiſdome, which the whole world boaſteth to be ſuch, but indeed is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and vile, you muſt change for celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall and divine. It is impoſſible to love <note place="margin">Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the love of God conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note> God, unleſſe you hate your ſelfe, that is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thou be diſpleaſed with thy ſelfe for thy ſinnes, crucifie thine own fleſh, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie thy proper will; that is, by how much any man is attentive to the love of God, ſo much more doth he ſtudy to mortifie and keep under the concupiſcence of the fleſh, and his owne proper appetites. Alſo, the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65322:69"/> further thou departeſt from thy ſelfe, and thy proper love, by the power of divine love, by ſo much the nearer art thou hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in God and his love, through faith. For even as inward peace dependeth on vacancy and leaſure from outward things; ſo it muſt needs be, that when the inwards are at leaſure, and the heart free from all creatures, it cleaveth to God alone, giving back from other things; the ſoule muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Selfe-love &amp; the love of God, are two co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary things.</note> into God by conſequence. Moreover, he that goeth about to deny himſelf, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it muſt needs follow, that he doth not his own work, but Chriſts: <hi>I am,</hi> ſaith <hi>John</hi> 14. <hi>the Way, the Truth, and the Life:</hi> without the way no man goeth on, without <note place="margin">Chriſt the way, the truth, &amp; the life,</note> the truth nothing is known, and without life no man liveth: Therefore look upon me who am the <hi>Way,</hi> which you ought to walk in; the <hi>Truth,</hi> which you ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; and laſtly, the <hi>Life,</hi> which you ought to live and hope in: I am the <hi>Way</hi> that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for all ages, the infallible <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Life</hi> everlaſting and eternall. The Kings way to immortall life through my merit, the truth it ſelfe in my word, and life through the power and efficacie of my
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65322:69"/> death. Therefore if you continue in this <hi>Way,</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> doth carry you to eternall <hi>Life.</hi> If you will not erre, follow me; if you will know the <hi>Truth,</hi> beleeve me; and if you will poſſeſſe <hi>Life eternall,</hi> put your truſt in my death. And what is that Kings <hi>Way,</hi> that infallible <hi>Truth,</hi> and that <hi>Life</hi> the beſt and moſt noble of all others? Truly, other life cannot be then the moſt holy and pretious merit of Chriſt, nor other truth then the word of God; laſtly, no other life then ſempiternall happineſſe. Now then if you deſire to be exalted into heaven, it behooveth thee to beleeve in Chriſt, and after his example to follow humility in this world, which is the onely Kings way. If thou wilt not be deceived of the world, take hold of his word by faith, and follow the footſteps of his life, becauſe this is the chiefeſt and the infallible truth. If thou deſireſt to live with Chriſt, with him in time, and through him, thou muſt die to ſinne, and become a new creature, becauſe this is life. In brief, Chriſt is the <hi>Way,</hi> the <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Life,</hi> no leſſe by example then merit. <hi>Be you followers of God, as moſt deare children,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65322:70"/> 
                  <hi>Epheſ:</hi> 5. Let us therefore with all our <note place="margin">Our life ought to be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the life of Chriſt.</note> might &amp; power endeavour this one thing, that our life may as neere as poſſible it may be, be moſt like unto Chriſts life, ſo that if other things be wanting to confound falſe Chriſtians, even this onely example of Chriſt might be ſufficient: for we may be aſhamed to lead our lives in pleaſures when Chriſt Jeſus led his life amongſt ſorrow and tribulation, even to his death. And if a Souldier doe forget his own proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, when he ſeeth his Captain by fighting valiantly, receive his death, and thou getteſt honour before thy Captaines eyes, uſed moſt contemptuouſly, ſhall I not ſay that thou doſt not fight under his Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? But alas, we will be accounted Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <note place="margin">Many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but few fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Chriſt</note> but how few be there that imitate the life of Chriſt? Truly, if it were the part of Chriſtians to be ſeekers after wealth, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing fame, and honours, Chriſt would never have commanded the loſſe of them for eternall good. Behold with me his life and doctrine, and thou ſhalt not deny, that nothing is more unlike then the world and He: that manger, that ſtable, thoſe ſwadling cloathes, are not thoſe a ſpectacle
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65322:70"/> or looking-glaſſe of the contempts of theſe worldly things? Or let us perhaps ſay, that thou wilt by theſe examples draw thy ſelfe from the true and right way? nay, rather it is meanes to bring thee into the right way, when we ſhall compare his doctrine and way together with his example: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſaith and proclaimeth that he is the <hi>Way</hi> and the <hi>Truth.</hi> Therefore when they by contempt, miſery, and reproaches, doe attempt to make the way to attain to heaven, it followeth, that thou that ſeekeſt after jollity and wealth, and thirſteſt after promotion, art in a ready way to hell, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne thou, and come out of that broad high-way, and come again into this way that cannot ſtray, and embrace the truth that cannot deceive. And laſtly, live in him which is life it ſelfe: this <hi>Way</hi> is <hi>Truth,</hi> this <hi>Truth</hi> is the <hi>Way.</hi> O the blindneſſe! a worm of the earth will make himſelf great, when the Lord of glory in the world did willingly give up his own life! Bluſh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faithfull ſoule, and doe not thou when thy heavenly ſpouſe, celeſtiall <hi>Iſaac,</hi> cometh <note place="margin">Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is the way to Chriſt.</note> on foot to meet thee, fit aloft on thy Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel: but like to <hi>Rebecca,</hi> who beholding her
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65322:71"/> Husband, for baſhfulneſſe covered her face, and comming down from her Camel, went on foot with him; ſo thou from the toyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome beaſt of thy proud heart, deſcend lowly upon the ground, and meet thy Spouſe, and he wil infold thee in his armes, and bring thee into his heart. Goe from thine own land, and from thine acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and from thy fathers houſe, and come into the Land I will ſhew unto thee: ſo ſaid God unto <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 12. Goe thou likewiſe out of the houſe of thy ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love, and proper will: for ſelfe-love cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth true judgement, blindeth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, <note place="margin">The evil fruits of ſelfe. love.</note> diſturbeth the reaſon, ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the will, corrupteth the conſcience, ſhutteth the gates of life, and knoweth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God nor his neighbour, expelleth ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, hunteth after honours, lyeth in wait for riches, longeth after pleaſures; and laſtly, preferreth earth before heaven: who ſo doth ſo love his life, loſeth it, <hi>John</hi> 12. but whoſoever hateth his own life, that is, doth deny his ſelfe-love, this man ſhall keep it to eternall life: ſelfe-love is the root of impenitence and eternal damnation; with the which whoſoever are bewitched,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65322:71"/> they are without humility and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of their ſinnes: the remiſſion whereof can be obtained with no teares. For they were not teares for God offended, but for their own proper loſſe. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. the kingdome of heaven is compared to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſtone, or pearle of great value, which to obtain, the Jeweller went and ſold all that he had. This Pearle is God himſelfe, or eternal life, which to obtain, all other things are to be left: of which thing wee have a moſt abſolute example, Jeſus Chriſt, who deſcended from heaven, not for his owne, but for thy cauſe; not to ſerve or profit himſelfe, but thee, and ſhall we then doubt to ſeek him alone, who did forget himſelfe, and for us gave himſelfe unto death? It is the part of a faithful Spouſe to ſeek to pleaſe none but her husband, and thou being ſpouſed to Chriſt, deſireſt ſtill to pleaſe the world? See then thou remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <note place="margin">What ſoule is the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and ſpouſe of Chriſt.</note> that thy ſoule is eſpouſed to Chriſt, yet not without a ſacrifice, with this condition annexed, that thou mayſt not love any but Chriſt; rather perſwade thy ſelfe thus, that thou oughteſt to contemne and put all things out of thy mind, that thy Spouſe
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65322:72"/> might deem thee worthy of his loving im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracements; for if thou dareſt divide thy love, ſo that thou beholdeſt not Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in all things, now thou art no virgin, but an adulterer: for it behoveth the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Chriſtians to be a chaſte virgin and without ſpot: Therefore as in the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> it was lawfull for the Prieſts onely to marry with virgins; ſo Chriſt our true high Prieſt, doth deſire a virgin ſoule, and w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is taken with nothing beſides his love, and ſo knoweth not her own ſelf in reſpect of Chriſt: that which he profeſſeth in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words, ſaying, <hi>If any come unto me, and hateth not his own ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ule, he cannot be my Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> What it is ſo to doe, to hate himſelfe, <note place="margin">Why a man muſt hate himſelf.</note> let us ſhew in a word. We all doe carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with us the old man, and are ſo, the old man himſelfe, whoſe nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is, to doe nothing but ſinne, to love himſelfe, to follow his profits and honors, to pamper his own will and the fleſh: for the fleſh and bloud is at all times like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it ſelf, ſtudieth it ſelfe, giveth honour to it ſelfe, doth applaud it ſelfe, doth ſerve it ſelfe, doth reſpect it ſelfe, in all things, it is eaſily grieved, envious, bitter,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65322:72"/> covetous of revenge: All which thou doſt and art; for ſeeing they ariſe and flow from thy heart, this is thy life, thine I ſay, of the old man. Wherefore thou muſt hate thy ſelfe if thou deſireſt to be Chriſts Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And he that loveth himſelfe, he that loveth his proper pride, covetouſneſſe, wrath, hatred, envie, lying, perfidiouſneſſe, unrighteouſneſſe, and wicked concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence, which without doubt are not to beloved of any, they are not to be excuſed and covered, but followed with profeſſed and open hatred, mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and utterly denied by him that will be Chriſts Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>

               <p>THeſe are the words of St. <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 4. of the old man, Lay aſide according to your former converſation, the old man which is corrupted according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of error: but be renewed in the ſpirit of your mind, and put you on the new man, wich is created according to God in juſtice and holineſſe of truth. And he expreſſeth the cauſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. For yee are bought with a great price, therefore glorifie and beare about with you God in your hearts. What the old man is, we ſaid even now, as <note place="margin">What the old man is.</note> pride, covetouſneſſe, luſt, unrighteouſneſſe,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65322:73"/> wrath, enmity, hatred and envie, all which muſt die in a true Chriſtian, that the new man might ſpring up and be daily renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The old man therefore dying, the new man quickneth in oppoſit to it, that is, pride waſting, humility ſucceedeth by the grace of the holy Ghoſt; wrath dying, lowlineſſe ſhineth in the room; covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe being extinguiſhed, truſt in God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed; the love of the world being taken away, the love of God waxeth warm. And <note place="margin">What the new man is.</note> this then is the new man with his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, theſe are the fruits of the Spirit, this is the living and powerfull faith: this is Chriſt in us, and his moſt noble life, this is new obedience, this is the new comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, this is the fruits of regeneration in us; in which whoſo live, theſe verily are the onely ſonnes of God; and therefore it is ſaid, that a man ought to deny himſelfe, as proper honour, ſelfe-will, and his own judgement, privat profits, and his own e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation; yea, to forgoe his own right, and not onely all other things, but to think himſelfe unworthy to live his owne life. <note place="margin">What it is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</note> Wherfore a true Chriſtian, and one that is indued with the humility of Chriſt, doth
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65322:74"/> willingly acknowledge that the man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <note place="margin">All things are to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Goe to then, let us compare together a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in deed, and ſelfe-lover, as alſo a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine man, and one anſwering to his name, and one deſirous of this deniall of which we ſpeak. If you offer the one a contumeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affront, preſently you ſhall ſee him wax hot, to be grieved with anger, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove him, to brawle and play the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in words &amp; deeds to be revenged, and to bind his allegation with an oath; all which are the old man, to whom it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and eaſie to be angry, to practiſe hatred and revenge. On the contrary, he that hath denied himſelfe, is courteous, well-pleaſed, patient, thinking nothing of revenge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing himſelfe to be worthy of all theſe, and much more, becauſe all theſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under the name of ſelf-deniall: of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65322:74"/> which patience, humility and lowlineſſe, <note place="margin">Chriſt denied himſelf</note> we have an abſolute example, Chriſt Jeſus, who ſooner would deny himſelfe, when he ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. <hi>The Sonue of man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> 22. <hi>I am in the midſt of you as one that miniſtreth.</hi> And Cap. 9. <hi>The Son of man hath not where to reſt his head.</hi> And <hi>Pſalm</hi> 22. <hi>I am a worm and no man.</hi> In like manner bleſſed <hi>David,</hi> when <hi>Shimei</hi> revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, denied himſelfe, ſaying, <hi>The Lord hath commanded him, for I am a worm in the ſight of the Lord, I am worthy farre worſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">All the Saints have denied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> 
                  <hi>things.</hi> Briefly, all the Saints of God, and the Prophets, have denied themſelves, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themſelves unworthy of any good thing; hereupon they did beare all things patiently, they curſed no man, giving thanks for their injuries, they bleſſed their perſecuters, and prayed for them that ſlew <note place="margin">What it is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our ſelves.</note> them, and ſo by many tribulations have entred the Kingdome of heaven. Thou haſt now what it is to deny their ſelves. That is, to acknowledge themſelves unworthy of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good thing, and worthy of all evils that might befall. And this is the Croſſe of Chriſt, which he commanded us to carry,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65322:75"/> 
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 9. <hi>He that will be my Diſciple, let him deny himſelfe, and take up my Croſſe and follow me.</hi> For this life of Chriſt is a croſſe to the old man, and to the fleſh and bloud a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, <note place="margin">The works of Chriſt.</note> yea, death it ſelf, becauſe he had rather lead an unbridled life after his own wil in this kind of pleaſure, then in humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, lowlines, patience; and laſtly, to aſſume the life of Chriſt entirely. Which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs is to be done neceſſarily; whatſoever is <note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of the old man is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the new.</note> the old man, ought to die in a Chriſtian: for thou ſhalt never put on the humility of Chriſt, unleſſe thou put off the pride of the old man, nor his poverty unleſſe thou cut off avarice by the root; nor the contempt of glory, and reproaches, unleſſe thou pull up ambition by the root: Laſtly, nor the lowlineſſe and patience of Chriſt, unleſſe thou correct thy deſire of revenge, and thy wrath. All which things the Scripture calleth the deniall of himſelfe, the bearing of the Croſſe of Chriſt, and the following of Chriſt, and that for no hope of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, merit, reward, praiſe or glory, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the love of Chriſt, becauſe he hath done this firſt, becauſe this is his life: and laſtly, becauſe he hath left this in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65322:75"/> Furthermore, ſeeing this is the Image of God in Chriſt and us, a greater honor then this none can happen to man: it were a thing very unworthy to expect other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <note place="margin">The I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God the greateſt dignity of man.</note> of our work and dai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly labour; for thoſe that define all things by the honour of this world, and attend this onely, by which onely part they are made better then others, when by their own judgement For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hath beſtowed all things upon them. The beginning and end of all men is one, <note place="margin">No man better then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> neither is one better then another, nor one entreth this life, or goeth forth with better conditions then others; and yet what mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is this of ours? we vex our ſelves wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and to other croſſes we adde a wheele of ambition, to the vice of ſelfe-love, <note place="margin">Selfe-love forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</note> from whence that mad &amp; giddy hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting after honour, doth ſpring or flow forth. Which whoſever loveth, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaudeth, and flattereth himſelfe in, and ſerveth both pomps, honours, and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, it is certain that he averteth his minde from God and Chriſt, to the world and himſelfe. And to ſuch as this appertaineth that of our Saviour, If thou wilt keep thy ſelf, thy ſoul and thy life, thou muſt hate all

               <p>IN a true Chriſtian the man is two-fold, <note place="margin">Man is twofold in uſe.</note> Exterior and Interior; which two, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be conjoyned, yet they doe daily differ by turnes, ruling and dying, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>If our outward man be corrupted, yet the inward is daily renewed.</hi> The ſame <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>The law of the mind and of the fleſh;</hi> to the <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>the Fleſh and the Spirit. The fleſh,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>coveteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fleſh.</hi> Therefore when the ſpirit overcommeth, the man liveth in a new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and a new creature, and in God and in Chriſt: But the fleſh reigning, the ſame man liveth in the Devill, and in the old na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, <note place="margin">The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and ſpiritual man.</note> without the kingdome of God, and is called carnall, and to be wiſe according
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:65322:77"/> to the fleſh, is death. Therefore according to the rule of either of them, the man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth his name in Scripture, according as the carnall man, or the ſpirituall man ſpeaketh. But if the concupiſcence with his ſtrength be overcome, it will be argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſtrength which the ſpirit hath in the inward man; and if it faint, it is a ſigne of the weakneſſe of the faith and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, becauſe theſe two are one thing, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>having the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>

                  <hi>of faith for which we ſpeak.</hi> Moreover, when one hath himſelfe and his proper luſts tamed, and keepeth them in their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he is ſtronger then he that overcometh a moſt ſtrong Tower, according to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Proverb.

                  <hi>his mind, then he that gaineth a Citie.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou haſt a deſire, and ſetteſt thy heart upon the greateſt victory, and to obtain it, then conquer thy ſelfe, thy privat wrath, pride, covetouſneſſe, and evill concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence, <note place="margin">What it is to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercom the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Devlll.</note> and thou haſt overturned the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Devill, which ruleth in the world by ſuch things and means: of which ſort of victors and conquerers, there be

Here conſult with me and adviſe, if thou pamper the fleſh over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, thou ſlayeſt thy ſoul; but it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to overcome the ſoule, that the body therewith may be preſerved, then that this overcomming, it with the ſoule doth pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: for our Saviour Chriſt once ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 12. <hi>He that loveth his own life loſeth it, and he that hateth his own life in this world, keepeth it to eternall life.</hi> But howſoever this ſtrife may have in it ſharp things to bee born, yet it bringeth forth in the end a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous victory, and moſt beautifull Crown. <hi>Be thou faithfull unto death,</hi> (ſaith the Sonne of God, Apoc. 2.) <hi>and I will give thee a crown of life.</hi> And 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. <hi>This is the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory which overcommeth the world, even our</hi>

What if ſome ſhould ſay unto me, Shall I then be damned, if ſinne ſometimes ſubject me unwilling to it, therfore to be put out of the number of the ſonnes of God, according to that of 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>He that ſinneth, is of the Devill?</hi> God
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65322:78"/> defend. For if thou finde a conflict of the ſpirit, and a ſtrife with the fleſh, that thou doſt thoſe things that thou wouldſt not, which are the words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> it is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of a faithfull heart; and that the faith or the ſpirit is averſe to the fleſh: for St. <hi>Paul</hi> by his own example teacheth, that this ſtrife is to be found in good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <note place="margin">The ſtrife of faith.</note> ſouls, when he profeſſeth plainly, that he perceived another law in his members reſiſting the law of his mind (which is the new creature, the new and inward man) and taking him captive in the law of ſinne, cauſing him to do the things he would not, and to will is preſent with him, but to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh that which is good, he could not: for he could not do the good that he would, but to do the evil he would not, that was preſent: Therefore moſt lamentably he exclaimeth, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death!</hi> Like unto which is that which Chriſt pronounceth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. <hi>The ſpirit truly is ready, but the fleſh is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Sinne reigning not dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, doth damne.</note> 
                  <hi>weak.</hi> Therfore ſinne doth not rule in man, ſo long as this ſtrife is perceived in him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it to be ſaid, that ſinne exerciſeth his dominion over him, againſt which he daily
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65322:78"/> fighteth; and that which doth not rule, the ſpirit reſiſting it, that conſequently cannot damne a man. It is the equall condition of all Saints to have ſinnes, according to that of <hi>Paul, I know becauſe it dwelleth not in me,</hi> (that is, in my fleſh) <hi>good dwelleth not.</hi> Alſo that of bleſſed <hi>John, Epiſt.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>If we ſay wee have no ſinne, wee deceive our ſelves:</hi> which vulgarly we call, <hi>Sinne dwelling in us,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from ſinne <hi>reigning,</hi> whoſe property it is onely to condemne: for that ſinne we contend with, and doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto, that is not imputed unto us. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking to the <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Now then there is no condemnation to thoſe which are in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who live not after the fleſh:</hi> that is, they doe not ſuffer it to beare rule: But as many as are not exerciſed in this daily ſtrife, theſe are not born again, having ſinne reigning; and therefore overcome, and ſervants of Sinne and Satan, and damned ſo long as they ſuffer ſinne to rule over them. This ſtrife is ſhadowed unto us in the type of the Canaanites, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 13. 15. whoſe remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the promiſed reſt was ſuffered to dwell amongſt the children of Iſrael, but <note place="margin">Myſtical Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.</note> not to rule over them: even ſo the holy
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65322:79"/> men of God, every one of them feele and ſuffer their imperfections remaining, who in the mean time ſuffer them not to rule over them, as becommeth the new man; I ſay, a true Iſraelite, and Champion of God, as contrariwiſe, it is fitting the old <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould be ſubdued and brought under. Therefore the daily ſtrife againſt the old man, ſheweth the new man, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth it plainly; ſtrength and victory ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a true Iſraelite, and a new born man. Laſtly, the warfare approveth him to be a Chriſtian: for the Land of Canaan is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant <note place="margin">The ſpirit ought to look, leſt the fleſh do rule long.</note> and occupied in warfare; but if it happen ſometimes the fleſh, or the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites doe invade the territories, it is the part of Iſrael and the new man, not to ſuffer a tyrant long; but having gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his new ſtrength and aid by the grace of God in Chriſt, and by ſerious repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and remiſſion of ſinnes, to ariſe from his fall, and implore and intreat the true <hi>Ioſua</hi> to give him victory, even that true Prince of his people, to lend him aid to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the Canaanites; which being done, firſt the ſinne is covered, blotted out of mind, and pardoned, and the man is again
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65322:79"/> renewed to life, and tranſplanted into Chriſt. Wherefore they who feele many imperfections in their fleſh, and cannot doe and perform all things according to their mind, let me perſwade them again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as true converts, and true repentants, to impute them upon the merits of Jeſus <note place="margin">The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt, is onely belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent.</note> Chriſt effectually, and intreat him to hide their ſpots under his moſt perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. This (I ſay) is the meanes, and this is the way and lawfull appointment of the imputation of the merits of Jeſus Chriſt, when daily repentance goeth before, and alwayes ariſeth from his fall. Which when the impenitent doe not, cockering and pleaſing the fleſh in every thing, and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at reſt under ſin reigning; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch as theſe cannot chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the merit of Chriſt to belong unto them; for the bloud of Chriſt troden under foot, can be no medicine.</p>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65322:81"/> but as proofs and trials, in which the fall is eaſie when we fall from God; and this is that forbidden tree with the fruits thereof, the eating whereof is ſo forbidden, leſt our mind reſting in them, doe take delight, and play the adulterer, after the manner of men now, who know no other pleaſure but what is taken and received from earthly things, abuſing thereby the creatures of God, meat, drink, and apparell, to the pleaſures of the fleſh, and vain delights, wherewith moſt men at this day are drawn from God. But it is the part of a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to think that they be ſtrangers or Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, <note place="margin">A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in worldly things.</note> whoſe neceſſity theſe earthly things ſhould ſerve, not for delicateneſſe, and that they ſhould not ſet all their delight and pleaſure in the world, but ſhould place it in God alone: but if they doe otherwiſe, they intangle themſelves in ſinne, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeduced with wicked concupiſcence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing womanly wanton and effeminate, no true Iſraelites, with <hi>Eva</hi> they eat of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit.

                  </hi> that is to ſay, naked, infirme and brickle body we bring into the world, as an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable burden we bring it into the world, which as the ſpoyle of death, when we goe out of the world, we carry it out again, and in truth poorer then when we entred: for being born, we have body and life, and things not yet ripe are at hand, cloath, cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <note place="margin">The bread of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians is the bread of grief.</note> meat and drink; all which being dead, we leave behind, and ſo now what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we had even from our birth to the houre of death; in this world the ſolace of miſerable neceſſity; yea the bread of mercy and griefe they were, whoſe uſe and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion in a moment death hath inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted and taken away: therefore nothing is more wretched then a dead man, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially he who is not rich in God.

Therefore thoſe which love the world, do not exceed brute beaſts in prudence, and die like a beaſt as ſaith the Pſalmiſt, they think not on heavenly things, they rejoyce not in God, they are pleaſed onely in earthly things: in theſe things they take ſweet delight and reſt, and having obtained theſe things, doe thinke they are exceeding well.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65322:83"/> Chriſt, whoſe doctrine and life wee we ought alike to love, and to him as an Image and pattern for all true Chriſtians to follow and ſet before them, to conform our manners, thoughts, and the whole courſe of our lives &amp; converſations. Who when he was the moſt noble of all men, he choſe voluntarily that life in which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is notable as for himſelfe, beſides ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream poverty and contempt of honour, wealth, and pleaſure: which three the world hath for their three Gods. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thereupon <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. he confeſſeth, that <hi>the Sonne of man hath not whereon to reſt his head. David</hi> before he was called to the Kingdome, was poore, vile and contemned, and being made King, eſteemed all Kingly ſplendor as nothing, in compariſon of life eternall, whereupon the Pſalmiſt ſingeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. <hi>How delightfull are thy Tabernacles, O God of power? my ſoul fainted and failed me in the Courts of the Lord, my heart and my fleſh were exalted in the living God: Better is one day in thy houſe, then a thouſand elſwhere.</hi> I have indeed a Kingdome, I have ſubjects and people ſubdued unto me, I have Kingly Palaces, and the Tower of Sion: but theſe

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65322:87"/> proper Idolaters, are turned into the fire <note place="margin">The love of the world Is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the fire of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> and infernall flood, of which <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> is a type, and this burning of the Tents of which we ſpeak.

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65322:88"/> would not have us love any creature, firſt, <note place="margin">Why the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are not loved.</note> becauſe love is the heart of man, and the moſt noble of all affections; which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is due to God alone as to the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and onely good. Secondly, becauſe it is a great folly to love that which cannot love us again; whereupon in vain are frail and tranſitory things beloved; by good right is God alone to beloved above all creatures, who out of his exceeding love created us to eternall life, redeemed and ſanctified us. Thirdly, becauſe naturally, like things are <note place="margin">Why man was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gods Image.</note> loved; therefore God made thee after his own image and likeneſſe, that thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt love him and thy neighbour. Fourthly, although our ſoule be like to wax, ready <note place="margin">The ſoule is the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſe of God.</note> to take any impreſſion put upon it, rather like a glaſſe repreſenting all objects ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, whether of heaven or earth, yet it is born onely to ſet God before it. Fifthly, as the Patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi> when he lived in <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> amongſt ſtrangers, and after twenty yeares ſervice, demanded his two <note place="margin">What our mind ought alwayes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</note> wives and his wages; and being provoked with the ſweet memory of his country, did think and deſire to return to the ſame: ſo our ſoule among worldly occupations,

Sixthly, becauſe men are good or evill by reaſon of that which they love; therefore he that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth <note place="margin">The fruit of love.</note> God participateth of every kind of vertue and good thing: on the other ſide, he that loveth the world is defiled with all the ſins and evils thereof.

So all men blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of their hearts the image of God, become according to the interior man, Wolves, Dogges, Lions and Beares; even ſo are all thoſe that addict themſelves wholly to the love of the world.

But whoſoever yet ſeems ſomthing to himſelf, is not yet wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched nor humbled in his own opinion, nor capable of divine favour; whereupon Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. <hi>If any man eſteem himſelfe</hi>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:65322:89"/> 
                  <hi>ſomething when he is nothing, he deceiveth himſelf.</hi> For God alone is all things, which he that onely knoweth, and doth not inwardly in his heart approve it, and ſhew it in his example, argueth the knowledge of God in him to be ſuperficiall and ſlight. Therefore if thou wilt give God the glory, and teach it in thy deed, that God is all things, it muſt needs be ſo, that thou uſe a moſt ſharp judgement againſt thy ſelf, and beleeve moſt aſſuredly, that thou art no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, after the example of <hi>David,</hi> who dancing before the Ark of the Lord, when <hi>Michol</hi> contemned him as an abject perſon, he anſwered, <hi>I will yet bee more vile then I have been.</hi> He that wil be ſomthing, he is the <note place="margin">The matter of which God maketh fools.</note> matter of which God maketh nothing; yea, a fool. And he that on the contrary, loveth to be reputed as nothing, and in his owne judgement is ſo, this is the matter of which the great workman maketh ſomthing, yea, halfe Gods; he who profeſſeth himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God to be more miſerable and worſe then all men, he in his judgement is made the greateſt and chiefeſt of all others: and he that in his own judgement is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſinner, him doth God account among
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65322:90"/> the Saints. This is in truth that humility which God exalteth, the miſery which he reſpecteth. Laſtly, this nothing is that of which God no otherwiſe then the old world, is wont to produce the men of God, and create them ſo; of which things we have <hi>David</hi> for example, whoſe baſeneſſe our moſt gentle God beholding, transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him into a moſt noble inſtrument; then <hi>Jacob</hi> whoſe ſaying this is, <hi>I am leſſe then all thy mercies.</hi> And Chriſt dejected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the common ſort of men, who alſo for <note place="margin">God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all things of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</note> us was accurſed and made a worm, into how great majeſty did his heavenly Father exalt him? For as a workman ſhewing his skill upon ſome ſpeciall peece of work, to labour it more exactly, taketh a new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, polluted with no mans hands: ſo that man that God will make ſomething, he muſt be nothing: And hee that will make himſelfe great, and beleeveth himſelfe to be ſomething, this cannot be the matter for divine workes, becauſe that which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and void, is it of which he after a <note place="margin">A man iudgeth himſelfe worthy of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</note> wonderful maner ſhapeth all things: which the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> knew full well, ſaying, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. <hi>He beholdeth the lowlineſs of his Handmaid,</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:65322:90"/> 
                  <hi>behold from henceforth all generations ſhall call me bleſſed.</hi> But he is indeed inwardly and in heart wretched, which thinketh himſelfe worthy of no divine benefit, neither cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall nor ſpirituall: for he that arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth any thing to himſelfe, this man indeed eſteemeth himſelf ſomething when in truth he is nothing, and therefore is furtheſt from divine graces, and moſt impatient of all arrogances, who if he judge himſelfe <note place="margin">What is proper to man.</note> worthy any thing, he taketh not all things gratis of God: for grace is not merit, what ſoever we wiſh to obtain for our ſelves from heaven. Moreover, nothing is proper to man, except ſin, miſery, and infirmity, all other things are Gods. Behold the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a tree with me, which is no more ſomething then a man, and therefore as it followeth the motion of a tree, from <note place="margin">Man is a ſhadow.</note> whom it hath its being: ſo this man car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth his life and all hee hath received of God, according to that of <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 17. <hi>In him we live, move, and have our being.</hi> And although apples appeare in the ſhadow of the tree, they doe not therefore belong to the ſhadow, but to the tree. Now think thou the like with me, the good fruits that
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65322:91"/> appeareth in thee, and are apparent, but are not thine own. But as the apple groweth not out of the tree, as the unskilfull vulgar think, although it hang thereon, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <note place="margin">Man is a very tree.</note> then a child on the mothers paps: So all men are fruitleſſe trees and withered, the Lord onely is their force and vegetable power, according to <hi>Pſalm</hi> 17. <hi>The Lord is the horn of my ſalvation.</hi> And that of <hi>Luke</hi> 23. <hi>If they doe theſe things to a green tree, what will they doe to a dry tree? I,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. <hi>will hear and direct him that he ſhal flouriſh, of me ſhall thy fruit proceed.</hi> And our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 15. <hi>If you remain in me, you ſhall beare much fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when a man is truly &amp; in his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding wretched, and moved at all times, and truſteth onely in the heavenly grace of Chriſt, then doth God reſpect him: which reſpect is not done, or commeth to paſſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a humane manner, and without force and efficacie; but is full of vertue, life, and conſolation. And as ſome contrite hearts are capable of this divine aſpect onely; ſo how much more cleare, amiable, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent it is, ſo much the leſſe doe they think themſelves worthy thereof.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:65322:91"/>
               <p> How much humility have we ſhadowed in <note place="margin">The tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves worthy of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</note> 
                  <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 32. who pronounceth himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of all divine favour, and temporall bleſſings? Therefore to his example and pattern a heart truly humbled &amp; contrite, acknowledging himſelfe unworthy of the leaſt heavenly viſitation and conſolation, be it never ſo little, crieth, O Lord, my ſoule, thine handmaid, is unworthy of thy great love and mercy which thou haſt ſhewed it in Chriſt Jeſus; behold ſince thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt me thy Sonne, I come with two troops, with the bleſſings (I ſay) of grace and glory. And indeed if a man would weep a ſea of teares, it were not ſufficient price for the leaſt heavenly favour or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. Therefore the grace of God is meerly pure and free gift; and the merit of man is nothing elſe but puniſhments and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall damnation, which every one know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">What miſera. men God reſpects.</note> through faith, and acknowledgeth freely; man conſequently is guilty of his own miſery, and is pardoned of God, that which cannot befall man without this zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous acknowledgement, and ſo to obtain the favour of God. Wherupon S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. ſaith, <hi>I would boaſt of the infirmities in me,</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:65322:92"/> 
                  <hi>that the power of Chriſt might awell in me.</hi> For ſuch is the mercifulnes of God, he will not ſee his workes ſuffer corruption, but ſo much the weaker it is in it ſelfe, ſo much more fortitude is divinely infuſed into it, according to that the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Paul. My grace is ſufficient for thee; for my power is made perfect in infirmity.</hi> Wherefore by how much a true Chriſtian in his own judgment is more wretched, by ſo much doth God pardon more freely, to the manifeſtation of the riches of his glory in a veſſell of mercy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. not looking to any merit of his by heavenly conſolations, more ſincere then all human joyes. Furthermore we call not him a miſerable man, not he that is poore <note place="margin">Why a man is wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> and deſtitute of human ſuccour and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but he that from the bottome of his heart acknowledgeth, and is grieved for his ſinnes: for if ſinne were not, there would be no miſery in the world, and ſo much could not befall man, but that he is worthy of much more. Far be it from us to grieve, becauſe many heavenly benefits are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, <note place="margin">Man is worthy of no divine grace.</note> ſeeing we are not worthy of the leaſt, no not the life we carry about with us. Which ſaying, although our fleſh think it a
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65322:92"/> very unworthy and hard ſaying; yet if we will obtain the grace of God, the truth is to be ſpoken, and every true repentant ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner moſt be a moſt bitter Judge and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braider of himſelfe for his ſinnes. Wherein then, and wherefore ſhould a man open his mouth?

But for <note place="margin">The ioy of the world doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the fear of God.</note> the moſt part all men are without the feare of God, &amp; do addict themſelves to world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſures, not knowing it is better continually to feare God, then to wallow
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65322:94"/> in the pleaſures of the world: for the fear of God is the foundation and beginning of wiſdome and devotion; all which the concupiſcence and delight of the world doth extinguiſh. For even as by daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition or ſorrow for ſinne, and mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">The re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>newing of the man with his ſoule.</note> of the fleſh, the man is daily renewed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our outward man be daily broken, yet our inward man is daily renewed in bearing heavenly fruits and celeſtiall, of unexplicable ſweetneſſe;</hi> So contrariwiſe the pleaſure of the world bringeth heavineſſe, vexation, and wound of conſcience; yea ſo great <note place="margin">The loſſe of the ſoul by worldly pleaſure</note> is the calamity of the mind, and ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie is the loſſe of heavenly gifts, which flow from the pleaſure of the fleſh, and worldly delights, as he that calleth them to mind, or would call them to mind, he cannot overcome or deteſt any of the worldly joyes. Two things there be which whoſoever diſputeth, and ſeriouſly pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth <note place="margin">The fruit of the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eternal ioy and miſery.</note> with himſelfe, hee muſt be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affected with worldly pleaſures, nor moved with calamities. The one is the pain of the damned, which whoſoever ſhall bee willing to conſider of deeply,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65322:95"/> truly the more for that cauſe, becauſe it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, he is never heartily merry or joyous. The other is life eternal, which he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not for that cauſe neither take out of his mind, nor <note place="margin">The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ioy and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</note> mitigate, do what he can: neither whereof becauſe we ſometimes doe revolve them in our mind, ſeriouſly can we revolve here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; it is no wonder that wee are both without wholſome contrition and ſorrow, as alſo ignorant altogether, and unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced of celeſtiall joyes: and it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty <note place="margin">The true cauſe of ioy and ſorrow.</note> of a true Chriſtian to be equally minded, who rejoyceth very ſparingly in earthly things, being full of divine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and life eternall; neither is he carried away immoderatly with calamities, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in adverſity; but againſt the loſſe of the ſoule only, he beareth it ſo, as for that cauſe all his life time he doth not refuſe to account it a thing worthy of lamentation: for a Chriſtian loſeth nothing that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little, of theſe fragill things, which periſh, but he ſhall receive a thouſand fold in another world: but if the ſoule once pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, it cannot be repaired or recovered. Bleſſed then is the man that findeth this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſorrow, and beſides that, celeſtiall and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:65322:95"/> ſpiritual pleaſure. But oft times we perverſly and crookedly doe laugh, when we ought rather to weep; ſeeing there is no true li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty or delight but in the feare of God, and a right conſcience, which without faith and holy life can neither be had nor kept: For faith accompanied with divine ſorrow, by the holy Ghoſt, doth correct <note place="margin">The hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the king dome of God.</note> the defects of man daily; which daily means every man neglecteth, and he loſeth the beſt cauſe and part of living, thereby he is adverſary to the new life, hindereth the kingdom of God in himſelfe, neither can <note place="margin">Who is truly wiſe.</note> he be ſet free of the blindneſſe of his heart. Whereupon it followeth, that he onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth the name of a prudent and wiſe man, who declines w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> all ſtudy what he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth ſhall be an obſtacle to amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life, and proficience of heavenly gifts; neither doth he determine to flie thoſe things only whereby any calamities might ariſe to the body and the faculties thereof, but much more thoſe things which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands to be grievous to the mind, or any wayes burdenſome. Be of good cheare then, and learn to warre like an enemy, and ſo continue: a valiant man can beſt reſiſt a
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65322:96"/> wicked cuſtome, according to that of Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>Be not overcome of evill, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the evill with goodneſſe:</hi> For there is no cauſe why thou ſhouldſt think thy ſelfe ſick of incurable evils; if thou reflect thy thoughts upon thine own mind &amp; cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; &amp; firſt view thine own proper defects, and do not curiouſly firſt caſt a raſh cenſure of judging thy neighbour in admoniſhing him before thou haſt controlled thy ſelfe firſt. Wherefore if this daily ſorrow, and ſpirituall contrition beget reproach and reports, and for that cauſe the good will of men grow cold towards thee, take heed therefore that you grieve not at it, but rather complain of thy ſelfe, as becometh a Chriſtian, and live Chriſtian-like, as thy mind deſireth; and that thou mighteſt in good works equall the dignity of the name of a Chriſtian. For it is meet for thee to be afflicted by the world, &amp; grieved at it, that therefore in like maner God might delight in thee, according to that of <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57. <hi>I doe</hi>

                  <hi>dwell on high in the holy place, and with a contrite and humble ſpirit, that I might quicken the humble ſpirit &amp; contrite heart.</hi> It is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that divine &amp; worldly joy at one time
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65322:96"/> reſide in the heart of man, ſo contrary they are, and ſo different in their off-ſpring; when the pleaſure of the world begetteth one in proſperity, the other of heaven is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in adverſity: I acknowledge it indeed to be beſide, yea againſt nature, to rejoyce in adverſity, according to that of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>As heavy, yet rejoycing; as poor, yet being rich; as having nothing, yet poſſeſſing all things.</hi> But the grace of God doth mend, and purifie, &amp; change nature: whereupon the Apoſtles rejoyced becauſe they were accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſuffer ſome things for Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. Neither do all true Chriſtians other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, who are made the new creature, and become other men, for they rejoyce and are glad in adverſity; and indeed thoſe things that diſturb the old man, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not diſturb the new man, who with S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>glorieth in tribulation.</hi> The joy that is from above, is more noble then earthly pleaſures, which he perceiveth very well by the contumely and contempt of Chriſt who belongeth to him, of whom if we be ignorant, let us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade our ſelves again and again, that this happeneth by reaſon of the love of the <note place="margin">True humility</note> world. A man truly humbled thinketh
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65322:97"/> himſelfe worthy of afflictions and tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and unworthy of divine conſolations. But by how much he thinketh himſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, ſo much more largely is he viſited of God: And by the more and the oftner he deploreth his ſinne, ſo much the leſſe is he affected to the world; yea it becometh more grievous and bitter to him thereby. He who conſidereth himſelf as is meet, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">More cauſes of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning then ioy.</note> more things wherein to mourn, then wherein to rejoyce: And he who exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth another mans life, ſhall gather more things worthy pitie and compaſſion, then arguments of envie thereby. When Chriſt wept over Jeruſalem, which perſecuted him, and followed him to death, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he deplored the ſinnes and blindneſſe of it, let us think the ſame is to be done to us, and no other matter more heavie and more worthy of tears, then the ſinnes and impenitencie of men. If it came to mind ſo often unto a man that he ſhould die, and that he was to plead his cauſe before God, as often as he in a penſive man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <note place="margin">Cauſe of mour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning.</note> diſcuſſes the matter with himſelfe of the helps of this life, ſurely he would be more ſad, and more diligent in the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:65322:97"/> of his life, and of repentance. And if the ſame man ſhould call to mind the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall torments, he could not but deſpiſe the world, and in compariſon of them, think all the afflictions of this world plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. From which opinion, and fervency of devotion, we are the more diſtant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are ſo much inveagled with the inticements of the fleſh. In brief, it behoveth <note place="margin">The life of the fleſh is the death of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> a Chriſtian moſt firmly to perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that if it goe well with his body, and that he flow in pleaſures of this world, that his ſpirit is dead, but that hee liveth if hee crucifie his fleſh with his deſires and concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcences, for the one is the death of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: if the ſpirit live, it muſt needs be the body ſhall ſpiritually die, and be offered a living ſacrifice, Rom. 12. Which way of life all the Saints from the beginning of the world did obſerve, eating and drinking with thankſgiving the bread and cup of <note place="margin">The bread of tears.</note> tears, according to that of <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 80. <hi>Thou ſhalt feed us with the bread of tears, and thou ſhalt give us drink of teares by meaſure.</hi> And <hi>Pſalm</hi> 41. <hi>My teares were unto me my bread both day and night.</hi> And this bread of teares faith by a wonderfull ſweetnes doth
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:65322:98"/> mix and temper; and the drink of teares is preſſed from the tender grapes of devout hearts, by true repentance and ſorrow, which worketh to ſtedfaſt ſalvation. As <note place="margin">The fruit of worldly ſorrow.</note> contrariwiſe the ſorrow of this world bringeth forth death, witneſſe St. <hi>Paul:</hi> the loſſe of honour, temporall and frail goods; and it is often ſo ſharp and bitter, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, that men catch themſelves in a net, or bring themſelves to their own death by divers wayes, of which there be many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in the hiſtories of the Ethnicks, for which it were better to be more moderate, and ſhew themſelves better Chriſtians, who know it to be far unworthy their profeſſion, for the loſs of frail goods to loſe their ſouls, which the whole world will not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. Far be it from us that for temporall goods we ſhould not mourn or thirſt after eternall, ſeeing the uſe of them is moſt ſhort, &amp; ends with death. <hi>When a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalm</hi> 49.) <hi>he taketh not all, neither doth his glory deſcend with him;</hi> which law is equally ſpoken to all, no leſſe to the King then to the meaneſt Begger; the dead body putrifieth, and ſo <hi>a living Dogge is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a dead Lion,</hi> as ſaith <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:65322:98"/> 9. yet the Lord will ſet the death at all times, and the face of them that are in bonds among all people, and he wipeth the the teares from every face, as it is written, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25. Therefore remember to carry mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratly the loſſe of earthly things, and that the whole world is not worth one ſoul for <note place="margin">The love of the world bringeth ſorrow.</note> which Chriſt vouchſafed to die; But if thou proſecuteſt not theſe frail things with ſo unruly a love, thou ſhalt be leſſe troubled with the loſſe of them; ſeeing this, that it is the condition of things beloved, that things loſt are more deſired, and ſo the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of fools afflicteth them, which are the <note place="margin">From whence the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur bati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the mind.</note> words of <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10. The ſons of this age doe gather goods with great labour, with no leſſe fear doe they poſſeſſe them, and with greateſt griefe forgoe them, which is the ſorrow of the world begetting death. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 10. we read of thoſe that followed &amp; adored the Beaſt, had no reſt: to whom all theſe are like, that adore the goodly Beaſt of earthly wealth, and avaritious deſires thereof, a kind of men moſt wretched, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, and full of ſorrows; whom perhaps we ſhall ſhall not evilly compare to Camels, or Mules: for as they by rockes, and ſteep
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:65322:99"/> hils, carrying Silken Garments, Pearls, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romatick Spices, and generous Wines on their backs, doe draw many ſervants with them for ſecurity ſake, and ſo at evening coming to their ſtables, their pretious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, and painted cloathes and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are taken from them, and now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weary and ſtripped, nothing but the prints of ſtripes &amp; foul marks of blows are to be ſeen: So thoſe which in this world did ſhine in Gold and Silkes, the day of their death being come, have nothing but the prints and skars of ſinnes through the abuſe of riches committed unto them.

For as the Iſraelites even now being about to leave Egypt, were daily preſſed with greater bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> going about utterly to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow their whole progeny, or ſtock; ſo <note place="margin">We car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of the world.</note> the infernall <hi>Pharaoh</hi> envying our eternall ſalvation, when we are neer to death, ſo much greater care and rapacious deſire of

Neither doth onely knowing define this knowledge, be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but thus much more he wil, that we <note place="margin">The lively know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.</note> participate, taſt, and have triall of the ſweetneſſe, well-pleaſingneſſe, vertue, and lively infuſion in our hearts, inword, and in faith, of his divine love ſo great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe without expreſſion. For ſhall we

Who have taſted the heavenly gifts, and the good word of God, and the power of the world to come; which in faith is obtained through the word: Neither is any other, the effuſion of the love of God into our hearts by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. wherein conſiſteth the fruit and efficacie of the divine word. And to ſhut up all, this is the true knowledge of God ariſing from taſt and experience, and conſiſting in living and ſolid faith, which therefore the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>Hypoſtaſin,</hi> and moſt certain eviction. Furthermore; this knowledge of God, which conſiſteth in living faith, is a part of the eternall and ſpirituall divine worſhip, <note place="margin">What faith is.</note> as in like manner faith it ſelfe is a ſpirituall gift, living and heavenly, as alſo the light <note place="margin">The true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God doth change the heart, &amp; brings forth vertue.</note> and vertue of God. Therefore when this knowledge goeth before, by which God doth as it were drinke to our ſouls, to taſt and reliſh it, according to <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 34. <hi>Taſt and ſee how ſweet the Lord is,</hi> it cannot be but ſerious repentance will follow, that is, the renewing of the mind, and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65322:103"/> of life. For from the perceiving &amp; ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid knowledge of the omnipotency of God, there followeth withall humility, ſeeing that it is not poſſible under the powerfull hand of God not to be made crooked, nor to make himſelfe ſtraight. From the taſt of the divine mercy, proceedeth love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his neighbour: for no man is or can be childiſh, or can deny his neighbour any thing, who is experienced of the divine love, and ſhall remember that God out of his meer mercy hath given him Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. From divine patience and long-ſuffering, ariſeth a wonderfull patience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his neighbour, and that ſo great, that if it were poſſible for a Chriſtian to die ſeven times, yet he would forgive his enemy that cruelty, being mindfull of the great mercies of God, firſt ſhewed unto him. From divine righteouſneſſe floweth the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of his ſinnes, whereupon he prayeth with the Prophet, <hi>To thee, O Lord belongeth juſtice, but to us confuſion of our faces,</hi> Dan. 9. <hi>Enter not into judgement with thy ſervant, becauſe no fleſh is juſtified in thy ſight,</hi> Pſal. 130. <hi>Lord, if thou regardeſt our iniquities, who can ſtand before thee?</hi> Pſal.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:65322:103"/> 143. Out of the knowledgement of the divine truth doth flow faith and integrity towards our neighbour, whereby frauds do ceaſe, falſhood and lying, and a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian with ſuch thoughts fortifieth his heart, doth not circumvent his neighbour; for by this means thou ſhalt offend the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God, which is God himſelfe, who when he dealeth ſo faithfully &amp; truly with me, it were very unworthy for me to carry my ſelf otherwiſe towards my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Out of the knowledge of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall wiſdome of God, floweth forth the feare of God, whom it is manifeſt to be the ſearcher of the hearts, to ſee into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of man, whereby deſervedly we reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the eyes of the divine Majeſty. <hi>He that planted the eare, ſhall he not hear? or he which made the eye, ſhall he not ſee?</hi> Pſalm 94. Woe unto you that are of a deep heart, that you might hide your counſell from the Lord, whoſe works are in the dark, and ſay, Who ſeeth us, and who doth know us? Perverſe is this your thought, as if the clay ſhould riſe againſt the Potter, and the work ſhould ſay to the maker, Thou didſt not make me; and the workmanſhip ſhould ſay to his
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:65322:104"/> maker, Thou underſtandeſt not? And thus farre of the true knowledge of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſiſteth repentance, and repentance in the renovation of the mind, and theſe things concerning the amendment of life; that which concerneth the other part of divine worſhip, and is that holy fire appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God for offering the ſacrifice, leſt he wax hot in his wrath, and ſend revenge. A type of this repentance was the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-drinking <note place="margin">The type of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> of wine by divine comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to the Prieſt when he entred the Tabernacle of the Teſtimony, which ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually belongeth to all Chriſtians: for if we will enter into the Tabernacle of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, it is neceſſary that we abſtain from concupiſcence of the world and of the fleſh, alſo from all things by which the fleſh may ſubjugate the ſpirit: for the love of the <note place="margin">Pleaſure is like unto wine.</note> world, pride, and other vices, as ſweet and ſtrong wine, doe cloud the ſoule and the ſpirit, whereby they are brought under the power and ſervitude of the fleſh. For even as <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> being overtaken with wine, left themſelves uncloathed; ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, pleaſures, and riches, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſtrong wine, doe invade, try, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65322:104"/> the ſoule and the ſpirit, whereby a man may be prohibited entrance into the Tabernacle of the Lord, that is, from his knowledge, and driven from his ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, loſing the difference of holy things and prophane, clean and uncleane, ſo that he underſtandeth nothing in divine things, and therefore neither can inſtruct the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple left in his charge with wholſome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which is a juſt judgment of all thoſe that mad themſelves with the wine of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, ſo that their own thoughts and intellect are not converſant in the true light; and at the laſt doe ruſh into everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting darkneſſe. Moreover, this repentance, or ſorrow and griefe for ſinnes, and alſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall faith in Chriſt Jeſus, before remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes, which as it doth conſiſt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſole merit of Chriſt, ſo no man can challenge to himſelfe this merit of Chriſt without repentance; whereupon remember the Thiefe upon the Croſſe, who repented before his forgiveneſſe, and Chriſt admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to Paradiſe: and that was not a ſlight or ſuperficiall repentance, but a hearty and true, as appeared by the chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his fellow Thiefe, <hi>And doſt not thou</hi>

For us, we receive puniſhment due for our deeds, but this man hath done none e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</hi> And moreover, he praied unto Chriſt, <hi>Lord have me in remembrance when thou comeſt into thy Kingdome;</hi> which certainly were moſt ſure arguments of a faithfull and contrite heart. And that free pardon of his ſinnes, which a repentant heart in true faith apprehendeth and requeſteth, is <note place="margin">Chriſt ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things for us.</note> of ſuch force as God excuſeth all things, which was impoſſible for us to expiate, and that for the death and bloud of Chriſt, wherewith he purgeth all things, blotting out all our offences, as if they never had been done, and his abundance of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, not now equalling, but exceeding the heavineſſe of our offences and ſinnes: Whereupon bleſſed <hi>David</hi> crieth out, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. <hi>I ſhall be made clean from my offences, and I ſhall be whiter then the ſnow.</hi> Now ſeeing the condition of our pardon is ſuch, and our payment ſo good, as the Creditor can make no more demands, nor the debter hath not any thing to pay; Hereupon it is ſaid, that God forgetteth them, and never <note place="margin">Why God forgets ſinnes.</note> more will call our ſinnes to mind; ſo that the ſinner turns to him; as witneſſes <hi>Eſa.</hi> 18.

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:65322:107"/> manifeſted unto us what is the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion acceptable unto him, which is the juſtification and remiſſion of ſinnes, that God alone be all things, his grace, as it is meet, ſhould be acknowledged, and with gratefull minds and tongues be praiſed for ever and ever. This then, as we have often ſaid heretofore, is the true divine worſhip, of which <hi>Mich. chap.</hi> 6. ſpeaketh, <hi>I will ſhew thee, O man, what the Lord requireth of thee, that thou execute judgement, and love mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and walk carefully before the Lord thy God.</hi> Becauſe therefore, O mortals, doe we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent to get remiſſion of ſinnes, ſeeing but by this alone we cannot come to remiſſion of ſinnes; for neither can thoſe ſins bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, whoſe ſenſe and griefe the mind never yet found by grace divine, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently never to grieve for them; nor hee which never had it in his mind to change <note place="margin">The true worſhip of God conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the heart, &amp; is not external</note> his life, and mend his manners. Which true and ſafe-making converſion, that God for his Chriſts ſake would beſtow it upon us, I humbly pray: whoſe favour alſo it is, that now it appeareth, that his true worſhip conſiſteth in the ſoule and mind, in the knowledge of God, &amp; in true repentance, by
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:65322:107"/> which the fleſh is mortified, and the man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed after the image of God, whereby he is made the Temple of God, wherein by the holy Ghoſt, the true and divine worſhip of the holy Trinity is exerciſed; I ſay, Faith, Love, and Hope, Humility, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Prayer, giving of thankes and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to God. And although this worſhip re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth God himſelfe; and is performed to him alone, let us not think or beleeve, <note place="margin">Why called the wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhip of God.</note> that God for his own cauſe, and becauſe it joyneth with his profit, that he inviteth us unto him; but rather let us be ſo aſſured, that he is willing through his boundleſſe mercy, to beſtow and communicate all himſelfe to us, with all his benefits, and to live, work and dwell in us, if ſo be we be ready through his true Knowledge, Faith and Repentance, to receive him. For no work is gracious and acceptable to God, of which hee was not the authour of in us; <note place="margin">What kind of works are plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſing to God.</note> therefore he commandeth us to repent, to beleeve, to pray, to faſt, not as to him, but that the fruit thereof might be ours. No man can give or take any thing from God, nor hurt nor profit him: for we ſow and we mow to our ſelves, if we be good; but
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:65322:108"/> we create evill to our ſelves if we be evill. And what dammage hath God if thou wilt not doe well? therefore he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thee to ſerve him, not for his owne cauſe, but for thine: who ſeeing he is Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it ſelfe, therefore amongſt things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and deare, and ſo fit, accounteth it, that there be many be who participate of his charity, yea of himſelfe; that is to wit, as a mother loveth her Infant, cannot but rejoyce that it ſucketh her milk from her; ſo God is to be thought of, out of his moſt loving com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating of himſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his manner to receive ſingular delight.</p>

               <p>IT is not the name, but the life of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian that maketh a true Chriſtian; whoſe daily and onely ſtudy ought to be, that in him Chriſt might be manifeſted, and be made conſpicuous by love, humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and humanity. In whom therefore
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65322:109"/> Chriſt liveth not, it followeth that this man cannot be a Chriſtian. Furthermore, it behoveth this life to be from the bottome of the heart and ſpirit, even as the Apple is derived and commeth from the naturall branch of the Tree, faculties and vegetable power; yea, it is neceſſary that our life be informed by the Spirit of Chriſt, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned after his life, according to that of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Thoſe which are carried by the Spirit of God, thoſe are the ſonnes of God.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it followeth, that a man muſt firſt be inwardly renewed in the ſpirit of his mind, after the Image of God, ſo as his deſires and affections be conformed to Chriſt, and his outward life proceed from the inward <note place="margin">A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ought to bee within as he is without, or ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be.</note> feeling of the heart, and be moſt like to them. And ſeeing that God ſearcheth the heart, and reins, as it is, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 7. it is moſt right and equall that a man ſhould have more in the inwards, and in the bottome, then outwardly, and in the porch. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it cannot come to paſſe that our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards can obtain the purity and cleanneſſe <note place="margin">The clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</note> of Angels, yet it is convenient to aſpire to it, ſeeing God accepteth of the votes of our ſpirits, and ſighes, and approveth of them, the holy Spirit helping our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and intreating for us with mourning unexpreſſible, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. yea Chriſts bloud purging us by faith, ſo that we are without ſpot or wrinkle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.

Which free holineſs and righteouſneſs is to

For this is the condition of all creatures, that the ſame place is to them both of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and reſt; for Fiſhes, the ſea; to Birds, the aire; to plants, the earth; and to the ſoul, God, according to the <hi>Pſalm</hi> 84. <hi>The Sparrow hath found a houſe, and the Turtle a neſt, wherein to put her young.</hi> For even as he begetteth evill to himſelfe, that ſuffereth his ſonnes and daughters to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der abroad: ſo he begetteth evill to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe that ſuffereth his tongue and thoughts to be converſant amongſt many men: he ſhall decline many ſcandals, if he keep them within the circle and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of his heart.

But no man can be joyned to God, who firſt doth not forſake the world. The ſame reaſon is of all ſeeds, that <note place="margin">The ſeed of God bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine fruit.</note> they bring forth fruit like themſelves: therefore if the ſeed of God be in thee, as the holy Spirit and Word divine, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that thou become a tree of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and plant of the Lord, to glorifie him, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61. Nothing is more frequent <note place="margin">Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous words offend the ſoul</note> then that a word may fall from thee or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, whereby the heart afterwards is pricked, and the ſoul abhorreth it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man is more ſecure, ſafer, and more at tranquillity, then he that keepeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at home, &amp; ſo containeth his thoughts, words, and his ſenſes within the threſhold of his heart.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Philoſopher was met by a certain man, who being imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently acute, accoſted him after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; <note place="margin">Man or no man.</note>

               <p> He who will ſpeake laudably, let him firſt learn to hold his peace: for to ſpeak many things is no eloquence, it is garruli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or pratling.

The Dove which <hi>Noah</hi> ſent out of the Ark, when it found no reſt, returned to the Ark. This Ark is Chriſt, and the Church, having on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one Doore, or Window, that is, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, by which we muſt goe to Chriſt for aid. As the Dove having made her flight, returned to the Ark of God; ſo doe thou remember ſo often as thou flieſt into the ſea of the worldly buſineſſes, that thou return by and by to Chriſt, and thy reſt; yea, whilſt thou art converſant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, and attendeſt worldly affairs, <note place="margin">The fear of God.</note> let it be done with feare and humility, yet let it be without ſecure and precipitate raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:

Wherefore perſwade thy ſelfe there is no more truſt to be given to the world then to the ſea; and that the externall calm of the world doth eaſily turn it ſelfe into a whirl-wind, and an evill conſcience doth obey the delight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <note place="margin">True peace and reſt</note> But if men would ſeek no pleaſure in ftail things, if they were not intangled with the world, laſtly, if they would truſt leſſe to their worldly goods, then they would by experience find more peace and tranquillity in their conſciences, and divine conſolations and viſitations would be oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner manifeſt, but ſeeing that they will not beleeve theſe things, it cometh to paſſe that they loſe that converſion, amendment, and devotion amongſt men, which they might find in themſelves.

               <p>THis being delivered, bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the moſt noble vertue, that is
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:65322:115"/> to ſay, Charity, doth inſiſt chiefly on foure things concerning it: Firſt of all, that it is the end of the Law, or a brief and ſhort collection of all the commandements, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by this, or in this, the law is fulfilled. The reaſon is, becauſe in it all the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements are fulfilled: and laſtly, becauſe without it all the gifts of vertues are unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, idle, and fruitleſſe. And whereas he ſaith in the ſecond place, that Charity ought to proceed out of a pure heart, that <note place="margin">The ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of divine love.</note> pertaineth to charity towards God, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it is requiſite, that the heart be void of all worldly love, according to that of 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. <hi>Little children, do not love the world, nor the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What a cleane heart is</note> 
                  <hi>things that be in the world, becauſe every thing that is in the world, is the concupiſcence of the fleſh, and the concupiſcence of the eyes, and the pride of life. The world paſſeth away, and the concupiſcence thereof, but he that doth the will of God abideth for ever.</hi> Therefore whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath his heart free and at liberty from all love of the creatures, ſo as he reſt not in any fraile creature, neither put his truſt in them, but onely from the bottome of his heart longeth and ſeeketh after God alone, after the example of <hi>David,</hi> who in the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:65322:116"/> 
                  <hi>Pſalmes</hi> ſaith, <hi>My fleſh faileth me, and my heart it fainteth, O God of my heart and my portion for ever, O God. For what is there in heaven that I regard, or in earth that I preferre before thee?</hi> This mans charity proceeded out of a pure heart. Alſo, if any take ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular delight, pleaſure and joy in the love of God, ſuch a purity of heart as the holy Ghoſt ſheweth in the <hi>Pſalm</hi> 18. <hi>I will love thee, O God my ſtrength, the God of my health and my refuge, my rock, my protection, the horn of my ſalvation, and my Redeemer.</hi> The <note place="margin">Charitie out of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> third thing requiſite to charity, was a good conſcience, which reſpecteth our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, who is to be loved of us for no profit ſake: (for this is the property of falſe love, and that which proceedeth from an evill conſcience,) neither in word nor deed proudly to offend him, and diligently to beware neither openly nor cloſely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from him, or hate him, nor with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, wrath or diſdain, to maligne him, leſt our heart doe check us in our prayer, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. The fourth thing requiſite in Charity, <note place="margin">Love from fraile conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> is faith unfained, leſt we determine any thing againſt the rule of Faith and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian profeſſion, and leſt we deny God
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:65322:116"/> openly or ſecretly, in proſperity or adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. Goe to now, let us conſider apart the ſingular heads. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Charity is the end of the Law.</hi> For Charity, or Love, which proceedeth out of true faith, is the moſt noble of all fruits and works of God, then which a man can doe nothing better, or more acceptable to God: for God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth <note place="margin">God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth not of us coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gifts and workes.</note> not of man any heavie things, nor lofty nor great workes to his ſervice and worſhip; but rather he hath contracted the moſt rigid religion of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a multitude of Commandments, and the variety of them, in Faith and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and hath added thereunto, the gift of the holy Ghoſt, according to that of Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>The love of God is infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into your hearts by the holy Ghoſt, which is given unto us.</hi> By which words he inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth unto us the originall of Charity. Moreover, Charity is not a heavie work, but a pleaſant and eaſie work to a good and faithfull man, according to that of St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt. chap.</hi> 5. <hi>His commandments</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines of charity.</note> 
                  <hi>are not heavy,</hi> that is to ſay, to illuminate Chriſtians, to whom the holy Ghoſt hath given a cheerfull heart, and a free will,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:65322:117"/> moved and ſtirred up. Furthermore, God <note place="margin">God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth not much learning</note> requireth not of us much learning or tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, but only charity, which if it be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, burning, vehement, is far dearer then arts, and wiſdom of the whole world, ſo that all other things, Arts, Sciences, works and gifts, without it are unprofitable, and thought of as dead works, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. For <note place="margin">without Charity every work is of no mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> learning is indifferent and common equally as well to Chriſtians as to Ethnicks, and the works of the faithfull and the Infidels in that are alike. But charity onely is the ſure Badge and Character of a Chriſtian, diſcerning the falſe from the truth. For where charity is wanting, there is no good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whatſoever externall ſhew of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and excellency it commendeth it ſelfe by. For God is Charity, and he that abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in Charity, abideth in God, and God in him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. Whereupon it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, where Charity is not, God is not there. <note place="margin">Charity maketh all things eaſie, &amp; is heavy to no man.</note> Charity is pleaſant and acceptable with God, and alſo the man that exerciſeth it. For where other Arts and Sciences, and Wiſdomes, are gotten with great labour care, and griefe, and with the loſſe of their ſtrength, charity onely cheereth the body
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:65322:117"/> and mind, doth adde vegetation, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the ſoule: neither is it loſſe to any, but rather of it ſelfe bringeth ample fruits. For love is the reward of the lover, and vertue is a reward unto it ſelfe, like as vice in like manner doth puniſh and torment it ſelfe. And when other faculties of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <note place="margin">What is done out of charity, hath God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, &amp; pleaſeth him.</note> and mind are weakened, and tired, and wearied, only charity is never weary, nor ever ceaſeth, howſoever Propheſie may paſſe away, Tongues may ceaſe, and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences may be deſtroyed, yea and faith it ſelf ſhall fail, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. What God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, muſt neceſſarily proceed from God: <note place="margin">He that loveth God praieth wel and freely.</note> for he approveth of nothing which he doth not firſt work in us. And ſeeing that God is love, therfore that ought to proceed from faith, which is pleaſing to God; and out of love, without hope of any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, that it ſhall profit our neighbour. And ſo ſhould our prayers ariſe from love. Oh then you mortals! imagine what pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thoſe can poure out to God, whoſe hearts are ful of wrath and rancor, which if ſuch ſhould recite the whole Pſalterie, they can nevertheleſſe be nothing elſe but abomination before God; when true ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:65322:118"/> conſiſteth in Spirit, in Faith, and chiefly in Charity, not in words. Let Chriſt be in our memory, who out of his abundant mercy prayed, <hi>Father forgive them.</hi> In a word, he that loveth not God, that man prayeth not; in whom the love of God is, that man preferreth nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, nor eſteemeth any thing ſo ſweet. He that loveth God, ſerveth him from his heart; he that loveth not God, he ſerveth not him, although he heap mountains up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mountains. So then nothing can befall a man better, or more profitable, then that the love of God ſhould wax warm in his heart. Whatſoever faith worketh in man, (and all things ought to be done in faith) <note place="margin">Faith in charity ſhould doe all things in man.</note> ought to be done in charity, no otherwiſe then the ſoule through the body, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, heareth, taſteth, ſmelleth, ſpeaketh, and doth all things; I ſay, after that manner ſhould charity doe all things in thee, that <note place="margin">All things ought to be done in charity towards our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</note> whether thou eat or drink, hear or ſpeak, praiſe or diſpraiſe, all things ſhould be done in charity, after the example of Chriſt, in whom moſt pure love wrought all things. Wherefore if thou doſt look upon thy neighbour, let ſincere charity fix thine eyes
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:65322:118"/> upon him: if thou heareſt him, let charity erect thine eares; if thou ſpeakeſt unto him, let moſt loving commiſeration go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne thy tongue. Laſtly, have a care and ſtudy this one thing, that charity through faith may be the root and beginning, and cleave unto thee alwayes, which can beget in thee nothing but what is good, and wherewith thou beginneſt the law of God, whoſe love alſo is the fulfilling of the law, or the true abridgement thereof. Which majeſty of the divine love, all the old Saints of God with admiration exclaime, O Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <note place="margin">The praiſe of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> of God in the holy Ghoſt, the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſoul, and the divine life of man; he who hath not thee, is dead, though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live; he that hath thee, never dieth before God; where thou art not, there the life of men is continuall death; where thou art, there the life of man is a fore-taſt of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life. And thus much of Charity, ſo farre as it is the end of the Law. Let us <note place="margin">God is mans ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne good.</note> come now to the other attribute, the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the heart, which conſiſteth in this, That the mind being void of worldly love, doth reſt upon God as his chiefeſt good, according to <hi>Pſalm</hi> 16. <hi>The Lord is the portion</hi>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:65322:119"/> 
                  <hi>of mine inheritance, and of my cup: thou art he that doſt reſtore my inheritance to me. Pſal.</hi> 37. <hi>The Lord knoweth the dayes of the unſpotted, and their inheritance ſhall be for ever.</hi> And therefore the mind of man ought to take his chiefeſt delight and pleaſure in God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, becauſe he is the chiefeſt good, and conſequently good it ſelfe, and vertue it ſelfe; verily meer favour, grace, love, low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, patience, faith, truth, conſolation, peace, joy, life, and happineſſe: all which he beſtowed upon Chriſt alſo; ſo that he <note place="margin">Why vertue is to be loved.</note> which hath him, hath all things. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that loveth God, ought to love al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his truth, mercies, goodneſſe, and all vertues: For the true lover of God, loveth all things that are acceptable to God: and contrariwiſe abhorreth and hateth all things that be againſt God. Therefore ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is to be beloved, truth, mercy, becauſe God is all theſe, meekneſſe, humility, by reaſon of the example of our moſt humble and meek Saviour. Contrariwiſe, a true lover of God hates every vice, as the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and enemy of God, and the work of <note place="margin">Why vice is to be hated.</note> the Devill; therefore he hateth a lie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Devill is a lier, and conſequently
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65322:119"/> other ſinnes, becauſe they are part of the Devill. And whoſoever loveth ſinne, as a lie, and injuſtice, this is a ſonne of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, as it is in <hi>John</hi> 8. Even as he that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Chriſt our Redeemer and Saviour, he alſo loveth the example of his moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent life; I ſay, his meekneſſe, humility and patience, he is the ſonne of God. But thou muſt remember that thou pray to God for this purity of love, who certainly, willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and freely, through the love of Chriſt, doth kindle it in thee: if ſo thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly with daily prayers ceaſe not to importune him, and offer up thy heart unto him every houre and moment. But if thy charity be could and weak, ſo that ſometimes thou faile and fall; goe to, riſe again, and goe to work, and renew thy Charity, be ſure the eternall light of the divine love is not extinguiſhed, God our moſt gentle Saviour will enlighten thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; which albeit it be ſo, yet thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt <note place="margin">The charity of God and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour cannot be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</note> pray unto God daily leſt at any time hereafter he ſuffer the moſt bright fire of divine love to be extinguiſhed. And thus much of the Charity from the heart pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the love of the world, and the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65322:120"/> creatures. Let us ſee now the charity of our neighbour, out of a pure conſcience. The charity of God and our neigbour is one, and they cannot be ſevered; neither is the love of God more manifeſt in any thing, then by and in the love of our neighbour. <hi>If any man ſay that he loveth God, and hateth his neighbour, he is a lier: For hee that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not his brother whom he ſeeth, how can he love God whom he ſeeth not? And this is the commandement we have received from God, That he that loveth God, ſhould love his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. For the love of God cannot dwell in the heart of a man-hater, or hoſtile revengefull man. Whereupon if thou haſt no pitie on thy brother, and knoweſt that he hath need of thy help, how canſt thou love God, that hath no need of thy help? As by faith we are united to God, ſo by charity wee are to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour joyned. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. <hi>He that abideth in charity, abideth in God, and God in him.</hi> As a man conſiſteth of body and ſoule, ſo faith and charity of God and our neighbour, doth make a true Chriſtian. And ſeeing that God is well affected towards all men, who is ſo indeed, it followeth, that he
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65322:120"/> is of one mind with God, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents <note place="margin">It is the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Charity to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile a ſinner.</note> to him; he that doth contrary, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary to God; becauſe he is an enemy to mankind. Furthermore, it is the property of this charity to bewaile humane errors, becauſe they repreſent as in a glaſſe, our own proper defects, and bring to our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory the moſt infirm condition of our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity; whereupon it followeth, that we are to bear the infirmity of our neighbour with patience, humility, and meekneſſe. Truly, ſuch as ſin through want of ſtrength <note place="margin">We are to bear with the weak.</note> more then of purpoſe, and whereof they ſoon recollect themſelves, doe rebuke and puniſh themſelves, and doe of themſelves acknowledge their ſinne: theſe truly are to be pitied and condoled, and doe deſerve pardon. He that denieth this, ſurely hath not the ſpirit of Chriſt. For to puniſh the fallings and infirmities of our neighbour, raſhly, and with ſevere judgement without mercy or commiſeration, onely is proper to him that is without the moſt mercifull law of God the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, and without God himſelfe. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, a true Chriſtian, and he which is anointed with the ſpirit of Chriſt, doth
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:65322:121"/> beare with all men in condoling, commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, and loving him, after the example of Chriſt. And this is the Touch-ſtone whereby every one is to be tried, whether <note place="margin">Where charity is not, there God is not.</note> he be of God or not. But if he find he hath no love of his neighbour in him, let him aſſuredly perſwade himſelfe he hath not the charity of God in him, rather let him feare God himſelfe hath forſaken him, wherewith he ought to be afraid, and be ſory from his heart, and ſeek to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his neighbours favour. Which being done, God through his love will marry himſelfe unto him; and whatſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after he ſhall doe in faith and charity, is, and will be accounted for good, holy, and divine. Moreover, by reaſon of the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent love of God, of his free will, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth all with his mercy and love; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is any thing more acceptable then to doe good; or as <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth in them, he will doe good unto them.</hi> Without charity in man all things are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together evil and Devilliſh; neither is there <note place="margin">Why all things that the devill doth, are evill</note> other cauſe why the Devil can do no good, but becauſe he is deſtitute of the love of God and his neighbour, and thereupon
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:65322:121"/> what he doth is altogether evill; neither doth his workes and counſels whatſoever, tend to other end, then the reproach of God, and damage of mankind, and that he may ſatisfie his malicious mind and rancor againſt God and man. For which cauſe he uſeth ſuch cruell and vengeable mindes to execute and bring to paſſe the counſels and contrivement of his wrath &amp; envy. And this is the mark of the ſonnes of Satan, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are diſcerned from the ſonnes of God. Charity proceedeth from faith not fained, which cleaveth and adhereth to God equally in proſperity and adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Whoſoever loveth a man heartily, he cannot be ungratefull, becauſe what God <note place="margin">He that loveth God, all his works he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, &amp; all his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> hath appointed againſt him, he doth after the example of Chriſt, who with a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mind tooke up his Croſſe which he knew to be put upon him by his Fathers will; whereupon <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>chap.</hi> 12. <hi>I have a baptiſme to be baptized with, and how grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved am I untill it be finiſhed!</hi> which all the Martyrs of the Church did imitate, bearing his Croſſe with joy. And for a truth, whoſoever loveth God heartily, he cannot but beare his Croſſe eaſily;
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:65322:122"/> which, he knoweth to be the yoak of Chriſt. And if a Load-ſtone can lift up a weight of Iron, and draw it unto it ſelfe, what cannot that celeſtiall Load-ſtone of love divine do? Shal not it take up the worſt weight of our Croſſe, and mitigate the feeling of it? Alſo, why doth Sugar rather correct the bitterneſſe of the hearb and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, then the ſweetneſſe of, love take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ungratefull and inhumane ſavour of our croſſe? whoſe force is ſuch, as the holy Martyrs had no other where that ſtrength of their incredible and cheerfull conſtancy, but they did draw it out of this fountain of Love, wherewith being moſt ſweetly intoxicated, they did not feele the paines of their torments.</p>

                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:65322:123"/> whoſoever therefore walketh in the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt, he ceaſeth to be the ſlave of ſinne; and ſervant to affections and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall luſts: For by the ſpirit of divine charity, we are purged and ſet free. And <note place="margin">The u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of divine Charity.</note> charity divine is equally reached and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to all men, ſo that not onely out of the word of God, but by nature univerſall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, it is made known: for we are all equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and alike covered with the heavens, and we have the uſe of the Sunne, Aire, Earth, Water, both high and low degree alike. Moreover, with what mind God Almighty is towards all mankind, ſo ought our mind to be affected towards our neighbour, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what things even now we ſhewed, thou doſt not ſay it happened for that cauſe God would have it ſo, but that by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample he might teach us, and make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that he loveth all with like equall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and that it is without re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pect of perſons, and prerogative of dignity or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in Chriſt to love every one alike; ſo that as hee ſheweth himſelfe towards us, ſuch ught we to be, and to carry our ſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owards our neighbour; whom after the ſame manner as wee ſhall deal with, God
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:65322:123"/> will deale with us. Which Law God writ in our hearts, that evidently he might convince and teach us, with what mind he was affected to us, leſt we ſhould be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and overtaken unawares, we ought to carry the ſame mind towards our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour every one of us. Wherefore he that would know what reſpect hee is in with God, it is ſufficient to ask his conſcience: for that thing will tell him preſently, as his mind is towards his neighbour, whereby he <note place="margin">The tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of divine love.</note> may gather how God is affected towards him. For like as we have done to our neighbour; ſo it is meet God ſhould doe to us. And in this ſenſe the great God is good to the good, and averſe to the averſe; neither doth hee deſerve to have God his friend, that is an enemy to his neighbour. Now ſeeing that God hath no need of our works, as our neighbour hath, it appeareth by this counſell, that the charity towards our neighbour gives us in charge, that it ſhould be as a Load-ſtone, a moſt certain argument of our charity towards God. For if theſe things were otherwiſe, he would not have directed theſe things to our neighbor ſo exactly as to a certain ſope,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:65322:124"/> nor bound us to this as a law, but that we might know his affection to us thereby, and we ſhould approve the ſame mind eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry houre and moment to our neighbour. Wherefore though Chriſt Jeſus by his death once ſufficiently made ſatisfaction for the ſinnes of the whole world, and all men therein, for which all men are to give thanks, no man can warrant him, who is <note place="margin">Chriſt doth as it were call back his merit from them that do not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</note> not firſt reconciled to his neighbour. For all mankind, under the perſon of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſervant, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. is deſcribed, who when hee had not wherewith to pay, the King remitted him all his debts; but when he afterwards behaved himſelfe ſo cruelly towards his fellow ſervant, the King revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked his pardon, condemning the wicked ſervant by reaſon of his hard uſage of his neighbour. Which Parable Chriſt conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with this farewell: <hi>So will my heavenly Father doe unto you.</hi> Like unto that is the ſaying of <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. <hi>What meaſure you mete unto others, the ſame ſhall hee meted unto you.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Chriſts man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date.</note> Whereby it appeareth, that man was not onely created for himſelfe alone, but for his neighbours cauſe alſo. And immediatly he paſſeth over the precepts of loving our
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:65322:124"/> neighbour, to withdraw the love of God, and to proceed with his juſtice, by whoſe moſt rigid decree hee is immediatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; but if we ſhould call ſuch things to mind as this Parable, we ſhould never be angry long with our Neighbour, neither ſhould the Sun go down in our wrath: for it <note place="margin">A heart irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilcable is not capable of Chriſts merits.</note> is in truth a horrible thing to be thought, that the merit of Chriſt, whereby he ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the whole world fully, and after the example of that little King, of meer grace hath remitted all our ſins; I ſay, that this merit ſhould be cut off, and become of no effect, if we do not pardon our brother, and hate him. But although this law ſeem hard, yet ſo it is written, and it ſo bindeth us, that God without the love of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, will not be loved of us; and if wee become irreconcileable, wee loſe the love and favour of God. Neither may we think <note place="margin">The cauſe of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> it was for other cauſe that man was not created one better then another, but that one ſhould not inſult over another, but as twins of one mother and one father, we ſhould live lovingly &amp; peaceably together, our conſciences never accuſing us. Therfore whoſoever hateth his brother and deſpiſeth
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:65322:125"/> him, let him know that God doth hate him, and deſpiſe him, becauſe he hath moſt ſeverely forbidden it, and conſequently that he is hatefull and abominable to him, as alſo guilty of eternall condemnation, and altogether excluded from the merit of Chriſt. Neither can it by any means come to paſſe, that a heart in enmity, without mercy, and inhumane, ſhould participate of the bloud of Chriſt, which was ſhed out of meere love: ſeeing out of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. it is manifeſt, that God was leſſe moved, or offended, for the debt of ten thouſand Talents, then at the unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulneſſe and cruelty of the fellow-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. Wherefore let us never forget, but daily remember that ſaying of Chriſt: <hi>So will my Heavenly Father doe unto you.</hi>

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:65322:126"/> all is his own; nor in humane offerings, which hee requireth not; nay rather hee abhorreth, becauſe they contain the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Jeſus Chriſt the Propitiatory offering which God appointed to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſinnes of the world; but in pure faith, which the Prophet deſcribeth in this form, <hi>To doe judgement,</hi> I ſay in the exerciſe of faith, in charity, in mercy, better plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing then all ſacrifices, &amp; in humility, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. <hi>The ſacrifice to God is a troubled ſpirit, a contrite heart and humble, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe.</hi> To which divine worſhip, conſiſting in the inwards of the heart, and in faith, charity, and humility, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. whoſe admonition we have prefixed to this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which containeth the praiſe of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the perpetuall debt to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. For certainly there is no other way of ſerving God but this, to whom we can approve of nothing but what wee our ſelves allow, and he himſelfe worketh in our hearts; ſo that to worſhip God, is nothing but to obſerve our neighbour, and to doe him good. To this love of our neighbour the Apoſtle inciting us, uſeth an
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:65322:126"/> argument ſomthing plauſible to thoſe which <note place="margin">Charity praiſed</note> are deſirous to lead a Chriſtian life, calling it a breviary of all vertues, and a fulfilling of the Law: not that we are able poſſibly by our charity to fulfill the divine Law, or that conſequently it followeth, to gain eternall life thereby; but it inſinuateth unto us the noble bounty and majeſty of this moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent vertue, and inflameth us to love it with all our deſire. For our juſtice and happineſſe is founded on the merit of Jeſus Chriſt, which we apply to our ſelves by faith; out of which alſo the love to our neighbour doth flow, and all other vertues, which therefore are called the fruits of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to the praiſe and glory of God. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then the dignity of this vertue is ſo great, it were worthy the labour to ſeeke more arguments to draw us unto the love of it, but the ſtrongeſt in my opinion, is that which Saint <hi>John</hi> uſeth, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <note place="margin">The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For as it is the delight of God to be with the ſonnes of men: ſo contrariwiſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill is a devourer of men. To which belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth that place of <hi>John,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>He that</hi>

For the knowledge of God and Chriſt is known by experience, and feeling and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Chriſt is meer love and meekneſſe, it followeth that he that is without chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is without Chriſt, according to that of <note place="margin">By cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity God is known.</note> Saint <hi>Peter, Epiſt.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>If you had cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, this would not leave you empty, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fruit in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>John</hi> 13. <hi>In</hi>

Which love of Chriſt who ſo hath not, this man is not of Chriſt: for how ſhould Chriſt know him which is deſtitute of Chriſt? For even as an Apple by his ſavour, and a Flower by his ſmell, is knowne: ſo a Chriſtian is known by his love.

               <p>THe firſt cauſe for which our enemies ought to be beloved of us, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, to which he giveth no other reaſon, but <hi>that you may be the ſonnes of your father, of him</hi> (that is to wit) <hi>that loved us when we were his enemies,</hi> Rom. 5.

               <p>IN the heart of man ſuch is his nature, and that property indued of God, that it cannot ceaſe to love: and therefore one man loveth God, and another the world, another himſelfe. Whereby appeareth the neceſſity of love, this moſt noble of all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, <note place="margin">Charity is the moſt noble of all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly due to God.</note> implanted by God, and kindled by the holy Ghoſt, is to be beſtowed in the ſtudy of the chiefeſt good, and given unto God by ſeeking daily of him that he would vouchſafe to kindle the divine love more and more. For he loved us firſt, which
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65322:135"/> if it meet with love again, the ſame doth more and more ardently imbrace us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of Saint <hi>John,</hi> 14. <hi>He that loveth me is loved of my Father.</hi> Now in whomſoever the love of God is, hee ought to love and wiſh well unto all men, which is the property of the love in God, and conſequently circumvent no man, nor to <note place="margin">No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing bette then the love of God.</note> hurt any man in word or deed: but for the moſt part all men are ſo faſcinated with the love of the world, that they never admit the love of God into their heart, that which they doe openly in their hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall love towards their neighbour, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of their own gain or advantage, not of him nor his. But it were more meet ſo to love the world, and whatſoever is in the world, that no injury be done to the divine love, nor the way or means thereof impeached, eſpecially ſeeing there is ſo great vanity and vileneſſe of the world, and <note place="margin">The crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of our love.</note> of God ſo great eminency &amp; majeſty as no compariſon can be betwixt them: for even as God doth infinitely excell all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſo doth the love of him in holineſſe, nobility, and dignity, goe before all the love we have to any creature, and leaveth
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65322:135"/> it behind, by a moſt exceeding diſtance, not to bee computed by humane reaſon: therefore no creature is worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to divine love. The words of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>Who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof?</hi> Let us make ſomething like to this, and ſay, Who is more worthy of our love, then he that put it in our hearts, and to whoſe love we owe our life? And we all live by the love of God in Chriſt, whoſe way of love is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us throughout all our life, what condition ſoever we be of. Even as Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, when a ſtorm commeth, do caſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor: ſo wee, ſo often as this great ſea of the world doth toſſe and ſhake the little ſhip of our heart hither and thither with the Floods and waves of ſinne, as wrath, pride, impatience, covetouſneſſe and luſt of the fleſh; we ſhould remember to ſtrengthen our ſelves by the Anchor of Divine love, and love of Chriſt, being ready rather to ſuffer the loſſe of all things then our ſelves <note place="margin">The love of God cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from us.</note> to be pull'd from him; of which mind we ought to be ſo often as we fall into ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all temptation, and be toſſed by ſin, death, Devill, hell, and miſeries, no otherwiſe
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:65322:136"/> then when we are toſſed by cruell &amp; raging floods and waves. For the love of God is that hill which was ſhewed to <hi>Lot,</hi> that he might flie unto it, and eſchew the fire of <hi>Sodom.</hi> For what other thing is this world then ſpirituall <hi>Sodom?</hi> Alſo, what is the burning of it, but the burnings and flames of worldly concupiſcences, which muſt needs burn thoſe that doe not endeavour to keep in memory the divine love, or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to depart with it? I ſay, of that love, or divine fear which preſerveth a man from the world, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> was preſerved from the wife of <hi>Potiphar.</hi> For no man can love the world, but he that never taſted the divine Love: no man can hate his neigbour, but he that doth not love God from his heart. For the ſweetneſſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of divine love is ſo great, that it mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigateth the ſenſe of all miſeries, and death it ſelfe. Such is the nature and inſtinct of Love, as all cogitations omitted, it is fixed upon that onely thing which it loveth, and forgetteth and contemneth all other things by reaſon of the incredible deſire by which <note place="margin">The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of divine love.</note> it is carried towards that which it lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth. Therefore can you ſhew any
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:65322:136"/> cauſe, O mortals, which ſay you love God, that for all things for which others are wont to contend, you blot all out of your minds w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> one ſtroke, I ſay, for honor, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and wealth, which you doe not ſtrive for this one thing, that you may enjoy God alone? That which in old time was done by the holy men of God, whom the divine love, with the admirable ſweetneſſe thereof, had ſo tied and fixed them thereunto, that they became forgetful of the world, and of <note place="margin">What man is moſt wiſe, &amp; who moſt fooliſh.</note> themſelves alſo. Whom therfore as fools, &amp; worthy to be derided, ſome did ſo account them, when themſelves indeed were the moſt fooliſh of all others; becauſe they preferre fraile things like unto childrens lakings, before the greateſt good. A true lover of God loveth him no otherwiſe then as if there were nothing under the heavens but God alone; and therefore followeth him onely: And by this reaſon he findeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65322:137"/> loveth any creature for beauties ſake, take my counſel, neglect thoſe things, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre thy love unto God which is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all beauty. And he that would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low any thing becauſe it is good, follow God rather, which is the onely and eternal good eſſentially, and without whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is good; ſo that all creatures for that <note place="margin">From whence all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do receive their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> cauſe onely are good, becauſe even a ſpark, and a little drop of water, be it never ſo little a thing, ſtained with many imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, becauſe they participate of that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean of goodnes; why then do we not rather love God the fountain and perfection of that which is good, and who is the good eſſentially, and the out-flowing of every good thing in ſingular manner? By how much leſſe earth or earthly gravity every thing hath, ſo much lighter it is, and is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier carried upwards: ſo our ſoules and mindes, the more they are addicted to earthly things, and by them are as it were, made heavie, doe by conſequence endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour celeſtial things the leſſe, and joy leſſe in God: weigh well alwayes the damage of <note place="margin">The gravity of earthly minds.</note> earthly love, with the divine love in bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and that which is neceſſarily annexed

               <p>MEmorable is this Sentence, becauſe <note place="margin">Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding man offends God.</note> he conjoyneth both God and Man, as alſo the love and offence of both, that every one, by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, in expreſſe words, that did offend his neighbour, might be judged to offend God, or injure God: Whereby that followeth conſequently, He that will bee reconciled to God, hee muſt
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:65322:138"/> do the ſame to his neighbour, ſeeing that God taketh the injurie offered to man to be his own, then he that offendeth God and man he cannot return into favour with him, before hee bee reconciled to his neighbour. As Chriſt manifeſtly beareth witneſſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. Wherefore it is needfull and a work worthy regard, that I ſhould forthwith ſhew that the love of God and <note place="margin">The love of God &amp; our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</note> our neighbour cannot be ſeparated, which is the true and moſt clear ſhining fountain of brotherly love. The words 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. <hi>If any man ſay that he loveth God and hateth his brother, he is a lyar: For he that loveth not his brother whom he ſeeth, how can he love God whom he ſeeth not? And this commandement wee have of God, that hee that loveth God, ſhould love his neighbour alſo.</hi> Which Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence teacheth the ſame that we exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted even now, That the love of God cannot conſiſt without the love of our neighbour. Whence alſo floweth or followeth this ſaying, He that ſincerely without hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, loveth God, loveth his neighbour with the ſame love: But contrariwiſe, hee that loveth, or can love either of both with falſe and fained affection, loveth neither of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:65322:138"/> them truly. Whereby it commeth to paſſe, that the love of our neighbour is a ſort of divine love, and that which is no other then a Loadſtone pointing out the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or hypocriſie of it. Wherefore we ſhall not erre if we ſhall ſpeake of a double <note place="margin">The double ſcope of man.</note> ſcope or end prefixed to man, whereunto all the actions of his life are to tend, as to certain tooles, which we ought to imitate and uſe: I ſay, charity of God and our neighbour, whereunto all our ſtudies ought to obey and be beſtowed, and we ought to profit and make progreſſe therein more and more daily, ſeeing that we are to this end created, redeemed, and ſanctified, although <note place="margin">The charitie of God is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt.</note> perhaps it is more fit to ſay, Chriſt is our ſcope, to whom we are ſo much the nearer joyned in neighbourhood, as we are neerer him in charity. For by this counſel God is made man that he might ſet before our eyes a living and breathing image of his love, and that he ſhould ſhew his love to be in the inſcrutable, incomprehenſible eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, infintie and divine, that men ſhould be transformed through Charity into this image of God, which is Chriſt.

                  </gap>o the Charity of God containeth in it the Charity of our neighbour; which are and be no more eaſily diſ-joynted and pulled aſunder, then the divine and humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Chriſt: ſo that he which hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured the humane nature of Chriſt, the ſame man is held guilty of the divinity: and he which offendeth man, is declared guilty <note place="margin">God is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</note> to offend God; nor any man, the bond of charity being broken, can bee angry with his neighbour, ſeparate himſelfe from him, but by that divorce he declineth from God, and ſinneth againſt him. Let us ſhew that which we teach by a ſimilitude: Even as hee that by the middle circle draweth lines every way from the circle about, or out circle, beginneth at the ſame or from the ſaid circle, but uniteth and gathereth together all the neere joyning poynts in the center, from whence it muſt needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, if we will take any away from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo God is a center, as it were, or a certain center from which hee departeth, that ſeparateth himſelfe from the charity of his neighbour, but he that will continue neer unto him, he muſt relieve him, and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:65322:139"/> participate by a ſympathy with him in his <note place="margin">Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion out of charity.</note> afflictions and miſeries: for if he do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it is manifeſt, in God he is not, who is as it were in a center wherein all lines are coupled together. And to this place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth the hiſtory of <hi>Job,</hi> which doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate what we ſpake erewhile in a moſt gallant, divine, or myſtical way. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when it was told <hi>Job</hi> by a meſſenger, that he was overthrown and ſpoiled of all his goods and livelihood, he ſaid, <hi>The Lord gave it, the Lord hath taken away; Let the Lords name be bleſſed;</hi> bearing ſuch and ſo great a loſſe moderately. But when it was told him that he had loſt all his children, even then he was much more moved, and began to rent his garments. Let a true Chriſtian doe ſo or the like, when he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of the calamity of his neighbour, whom the children of <hi>Job</hi> do repreſent, let him know that muſt be more grievous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, then if that affliction had touched his fields. For the property of true love is to be more moved with other mens miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, then his owne. Therefore O happy <note place="margin">The happy life in or of love.</note> mankind, if we could all live in love, frauds would ceaſe, injuries would not be known,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:65322:140"/> neither would there a man be found to vex another, or complain of damage. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we might think of this, therefore God Almighty in the beginning of the world, when he had brought forth many beaſts and plants, on the other ſide created but one man, from him by and by produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>Eva,</hi> that humane kind derived from one ſtock or root, and mindfull of his own originall and kindred, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire in love, and mutuall affection one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another. The excellency of charity commanded by God to us, is onely want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that cauſeth us to faint both in ſtrength of body and mind, a thing moſt convenient to our nature, and that which bringeth with it a moſt quiet life. And if the ſame God Almighty had commanded thee to hate thy neighbour, then he had ſet thee a farre ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>der burden, and heavier yoak upon thee: for the hatred &amp; revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of a mind of an enemy, doth tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and cruciate it ſelfe. On the other <note place="margin">To love is more eaſie then to hate.</note> ſide, love onely recreateth the whole man. Alſo, to thoſe that love God, it is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant thing to love their neighbour; onely it is hard and difficult to thoſe who do not
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:65322:140"/> love God. But if thy depraved nature hold it a hard matter to ſettle it on the love of thy neighbour, bethink thy ſelf, thou ſhalt take in hand a farre harder task if thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the pangs of hell; which if thou hadſt rather to doe, then be reconciled to thy neighbour, certainly then thou art <note place="margin">Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion brings reſt.</note> the moſt unhappy of all men alive; ſeeing it is no great labour, nor can be, in recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, which a man of ſmall experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may underſtand.

Contrariwiſe, hatred and revenge doth vex and torment them: For this is the property of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, that he that hath them, of their own accord they increaſe in worthy eſteem and honour: and of vices, that they puniſh their favourers with the puniſhment which they deſerve. But how friendſhips are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, we are taught by Scripture, which <note place="margin">Vertue is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:65322:141"/> they have offended; and if there be none <note place="margin">Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a part of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> to receive it, to give it to the Lord. Which reſtitution of things taken away, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in expreſſe words, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. and is part of true repentance. Whereupon B. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, The ſinne is not remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, unleſſe the thing taken be reſtored; and by and by, as a declaration of what he had ſpoken, he addeth, When the thing (ſaith he) that is taken away, may bee reſtored, and is not reſtored, there is no repentance that is true, but fained. Becauſe it is the property of true repentance which conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth man unto God, to contemne all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and eſteeme all things as dung, in reſpect of the grace of God (that which <hi>Zacheus</hi> by his example teacheth us to doe, very few ſuch are now to be found) to cleanſe their heart, to purge their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences by faith and reſtitution of the thing wrongfully detained. For which in the heart and in the conſcience he remaineth a thiefe before God, who keepeth back <note place="margin">He that reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is a thiefe</note> and doth not reſtore the thing taken away by theft; howſoever hee ceaſe to ſteale any more thereafter. Wherefore that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance may be true, and the conſcience may
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:65322:141"/> be pure, reſtitution is to be made as much as poſſibly may be; or otherwiſe, he muſt pray to God with all his heart, that he would in his room or place reſtore the things taken <note place="margin">God is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe there be firſt reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</note> away to his neighbour. For ſeeing that a ſinner is bound in two things, to God &amp; his neighbour, that his repentance may be full, both are to be ſatisfied, God not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging repentance unleſſe a man be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to his neighbour. Therefore it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth not, no, if thou ſhalt ſay unto God, Moſt loving God, I doe acknowledge and confeſſe that I have offended and done in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to my neighbour, I have damaged him by wicked gain and fraud; and laſtly, have dealt ſo with him as I would not another ſhould deale with mee; which iniquity I humbly intreat thee to pardon me for thy Sons ſake. And even this prayer is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, which God repelleth nevertheleſſe, and ſaith, Reſtore that which w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> fraud &amp; uſury thou haſt taken, and thy pardon ſhall bee ready. Not indeed as if a man after this manner ſhould deſerve remiſſion; No, not ſo, but becauſe not this onely is due to his neighbour, but many things more by him are owing to his neighbour, &amp; that becauſe

                  <hi>eat, and live for ever, the Lord God ſent him out of the Paradiſe of pleaſure, that he might labour the earth from whence he was taken.</hi> So Almighty God, in the midſt of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe of the Chriſtian Church, ſet Chriſt Jeſus, that all the faithfulll from him might draw life and ſpirit, and be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For all Chriſtian diſcipline conſiſteth in Faith and Charity; and the ſumme of Chriſtian life in generall, by reaſon of faith in Chriſt, is pleaſant &amp; acceptable to God: So in like manner we cannot approve or allow of the reaſons of our neighbour, but through charity. And ſo true it is, that all vertues without charity, are nothing, and dead, that faith it ſelf is not excepted; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> although it onely juſtifieth when it onely apprehendeth the merit of Chriſt, neither in the buſineſſe of juſtification any reaſon of workes going before, preſent; or to come, or to follow, but Chriſt onely is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of, yet it is moſt ſure, where cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity doth not follow, there is not true faith, but hypocriticall, although it work by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. For even as a body deſtitute of a ſoule, is dead; ſo the ſpirituall or inward
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:65322:143"/> man, whoſe members are vertues, if cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity be wanting, with all his members ought to be accounted for dead. Whereupon B. <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſet it as a Loadſtone of faith, and ſuch faith doth require as <hi>worketh by charity.</hi> Truly I know well, in the work of juſtification, that faith without works doth conſiſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. but that it ſhould want works, I profeſſe it cannot be, when it ſhall have to doe amongſt men in the market of charity. Wherefore to the <hi>Galatians, chap.</hi> 5. it is called <hi>Faith which worketh by charity.</hi> And 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. the fruits of this moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Tree are remarked to bee fourteen. And the firſt of theſe is <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Long-ſuffering,</hi> whoſe nature and conſtitution no man better expreſſeth, then Chriſt himſelfe the true tree of life, whoſe goodly fruits we ought to eat, and turn them into the juice and bloud of Chriſt. Therefore even as he by his wonderfull long-ſuffering, did beare the malice and ſinne of the world, that he might allure and draw ſinners to repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. So then alſo order thy life and manners that the moſt gentle Chriſt may live in thee, and thou in him, as a member united to his head, and breathe
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:65322:144"/> together. The ſecond fruit is <hi>Benignity,</hi> or well-doing, which was chiefe and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall in Chriſt, according to <hi>Pſalm</hi> 45. <hi>All grace did drop from thy lips.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> 4. <hi>They wondred at the words of grace which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded out of his lips.</hi> Which doe thou heare, that thou mayſt follow, and to cauſe thee love thy neighbour, Chriſt will ſpeak by thy mouth, and thou ſhalt remain united to him in perpetuall charity. The third fruit is, not to be <hi>emulous,</hi> or <hi>revengefull,</hi> but to remit and pardon, then which nothing is more proper to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>He will not be angry for ever, threaten thee eternally. He hath not done to us accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our offences, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.</hi> To which like is that of <hi>Ezekiel, chap.</hi> 18. <hi>If the wicked ſhall repent him of all his ſinnes and iniquities that he hath wrought, he ſhall live by his life, and ſhall not die; I will not remember all his iniquities which he hath wrought.</hi> And in <hi>Jeremy</hi> 31. <hi>In perpetuall love have I loved thee, therefore have I drawn thee to me in mercy: I will have pitie on them, I will be reconciled as concerning their iniquities, and I will remember their ſins no more.</hi> And in <hi>Eſay, chap.</hi> 43. <hi>I am, I am he</hi>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:65322:144"/> 
                  <hi>that blotteth out thy iniquities for my own ſake, and I will not remember thy ſins.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe thou the ſame, remit, I ſay, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and forget thy neighbour, and in like manner Chriſt will pardon thine offences, and thou ſhalt have his Spirit, and ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in him. The fourth fruit is, not to <hi>miſ-judge thy neighbour,</hi> nor cauſeleſly, or crookedly, or perverſly to deride thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour before others, or by ſycophantizing or colluſion, to damnifie him: but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, let thy heart bee ſeen in thy brow, and doe all things ingenuouſly and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without hypocriſie. Example whereof Chriſt gives unto us, who carried himſelfe equally to his friends and foes; and from the bottome of his heart would that all ſhould be moſt rightly guided, both in deeds and counſell: in which foot-ſteps whoſoever doth inſiſt, in him doth remain the candor and ingenuity of Chriſt. Therefore let all of us from the heart ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the good of others, by which means we ſhall remain united as true members to Chriſt our head. The fifth fruit is, <hi>Not to be puffed up,</hi> to inſult or wax proud, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Chriſt Jeſus the tree of life, to whom
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:65322:145"/> the woman, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. with a loud voice in a great aſſembly and concourſe, was bound to ſay, <hi>Bleſſed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps that gave thee ſuck:</hi> He turned this praiſe moſt worthily due, from himſelfe to them that feared and loved God; yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubjecting himſelfe, ſaying, <hi>Happy are they that heare the word of God, and keep it.</hi> And this is the character of true love, to transferre all his praiſes due to himſelf, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his neighbour: which if thou, after the example of Chriſt, doſt reſolve to doe, then truly humble Chriſt liveth in thee, and thou in him. In the ſixth place, true cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <hi>is not cruell,</hi> not diſdainfull, not rough, not diſcourteous in manners, but tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and compoſed to all humanity: which Charity Chriſt uſed, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of <hi>Eſay, chap.</hi> 42. who was not rigid nor turbulent, but with admirable gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſweetneſſe of tongue, hee accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated <note place="margin">The worſhip of God profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not God, but our ſelves.</note> himſelfe to his neighbour, and commanded the ſame to others. Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtudieth to imitate him, hee is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into his Image, and is united by an everlaſting conſpiration. The ſeventh fruit of love is, <hi>Not to ſeek that which is his own,</hi>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:65322:145"/> nor to have nothing more acceptable or pleaſing, then <hi>gratis,</hi> or without expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſerve others, and as much as he can to be helpfull to others: that which onely God moſt abundantly performeth, giving all things to us freely, and commanding his worſhip and feare unto us, not for his own ſake, but that we might receive the fruit of his divine love, and carry away the bleſſing thereby. So Chriſt had no recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence but onely the cauſe of our ſalvation: neither did he come to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter unto us; and like unto the tree which without envie or reſpect of perſons doth give his fruits ſuch as he hath received of God, firſt to all men indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, doth wholly ſpend himſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon us: yea, God himſelfe in Chriſt hath reacht himſelf with all his gifts to humane kind, and delivered it by a right of property to have and poſſeſſe them in this thing, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly making himſelf to be the chief good, which needs muſt be moſt ſpecially in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating himſelfe; he who ſtudieth to make himſelfe like unto him, he ſhall be a plantation of the Lord to his glory, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61. and Chriſt ſhall bud and flouriſh in
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:65322:146"/> him a living vine, and a Palm alwayes flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, or waxing green. The eighth fruit of love is, <hi>not to be provoked to anger,</hi> not to be inflamed with anger, nor that which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth man no man, to utter wrath concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by curſing &amp; railing ſpeeches, but to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Chriſt Jeſus, which did not cry out or open his mouth, witneſſe <hi>Eſay, cha.</hi> 42. nor any kind of bitterneſſe, but ſpake meer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction and life. And although hee did denounce threats againſt <hi>Chorazin, Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum,</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> and againſt the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees themſelves, uttering many woes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, yet it came not from a cruell or vengeative mind, it was a ſerious and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere exhortation to repentance. Therefore let us be wary leſt any root of bitterneſſe ſpringing again, doe hinder our charitie, and many bee offended thereby, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. The ninth fruit of charity is, <hi>Not to think any evill,</hi> which is the property of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, as hee teſtifieth, <hi>Jeremy</hi> 39. <hi>I know the thoughts which I think of you, or concerning you, the thoughts of peace and not of affliction, that I may give an end, and have patience. Seek me and you ſhall find me, when you ſhall ſeeke me with your whole hearts.</hi> Whereupon
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:65322:146"/> it followeth, He that hath the thoughts of peace towards his neighbour, hath the heart of God, and the underſtanding of Chriſt, and as a living member knit unto his head, is inſpired of him. Tenthly, <hi>It rejoyceth not in iniquity,</hi> nor in the injury or oppreſſion of injuſtice, as wicked <hi>Shimei</hi> did when <hi>David</hi> fled from <hi>Abſolom,</hi> but it imitates Chriſt Jeſus, who with moſt tender compaſſion beholding <hi>Peters</hi> perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, did with his moſt benigne aſpect recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him according to the <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 146.

Let us imitate this ſo great a Maſter of love, and if any bee fallen from his love, let us deplore him after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Let us inſtruct him in the ſpirit of love and lenity, and help to beare his burden, that we may fulfill the Law of Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 6. His law, I ſay, that firſt did beare the burden of our ſinnes, and let him be in us as in true
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:65322:147"/> members of our head, life, ſenſe and ſpirit. The eleventh fruit, <hi>Doth rejoyee together with the truth,</hi> and where all things are done rightly and decently; after the example of Chriſt, who at the return of his ſeventie diſciples at their well doing rejoyced very heartily, and confeſſed himſelfe to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father; and alſo the Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven doe rejoyce, as Chriſt teacheth, at the return of a ſinner: which if we do the like, then truly we have the underſtanding of God and Angels. The twelfth fruit of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is to <hi>ſuffer all thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>gs,</hi> as may appeare by this bond of peace, after the example of bleſſed <hi>Paul, I am made weak with the weak, that I might profit the weak: I am made all things with all men, that I may ſave all men.</hi> The ſame <hi>beleeveth all things,</hi> ſuſpecting no evill of his neighbour; <hi>hopeth all things,</hi> praying that nothing may fall amiſſe to his neighbour: laſtly, <hi>It ſuſtaineth all things,</hi> that it may goe ſo much the better with his neighbour, and more profitable. All which our Saviour by a lively example of his life did teach us, by bearing moſt heavie injuries and reproaches for our ſins, as alſo moſt inhumane ſcourgings, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:65322:147"/> poverty and hunger, that we in him and by him, might obtain joy and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. The thirteenth fruit of love is, <hi>Not</hi>

                  <hi>to be weary, nor to ceaſe.</hi> Like unto God, <hi>whoſe mercy from eternity to eternity is upon thoſe that feare him, Pſalm</hi> 103. <hi>who reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that he may have mercy on us, and roſe up to ſpare us, Eſay</hi> 30. <hi>whoſe love is ſtrong as death, Cant.</hi> 4. <hi>which many waters cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh, Cant.</hi> 8. <hi>Laſtly, from which nothing can ſeparate us, Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>who hath mercy on us with everlaſting mercies.

                  <hi>Paul</hi> doth adorn Charity with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny praiſes, you muſt know that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is love; and conſequently, like praiſe to belong to both: neither greater or more ample vertue to be found in man or in God himſelfe. Now that which reſpecteth our neighbour is twofold, one true, living, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and cleare; the other, hypocriticall and diſſembled, or cloaked. The firſt St. <note place="margin">True love &amp; falſe.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribeth by a moſt ample catalogue, and an account of the fruits and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof added thereunto: the latter
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:65322:151"/> with all his words, gifts and workes, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as a Bawd, to and for private gain and honour: And howſoever in outward ſhew it ſeemeth to affect divine and humane good and profit, yet inwardly and in his heart he reſpecteth nothing but his private profit, and honour, and wealth; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever floweth from this fountain, cometh not from God, but from the Devill, and it <note place="margin">What ariſeth not of charity, ariſeth not of God.</note> is poyſon, infecting all good workes, and the moſt excellent gifts. For as a flower in ſight, taſt, and ſmell, moſt beautifull and ſweet, if it retain any venome, is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the beauty of the colour, nor pleaſantneſſe of ſmell, nor ſweetneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is deadly or hurtfull to man, if it be not foreſeen: So man, if he be adorned with the gifts of Angels, and if he be full of avarice, pride, ſelfe-love, and arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, then thoſe gifts doe not onely faile in their fruits, but become pernicious: for that which is good indeed, ought to have God in the beginning and ending: who as he is the onely author of every good thing, <note place="margin">What is good.</note> ſo whatſoever he worketh in thee, is truly that onely good. But it is otherwiſe, if ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy, ſelfe-love, the deſire of honour,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:65322:151"/> or private profit, ſhall have any deſigne in it: for when it commeth not from God, his impulſion and provocation, it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be good. Therefore God alone is good, alſo love it ſelf, by which all good is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to our neighbour through love, no otherwiſe then from God to our ſelves, this neceſſarily cometh to paſſe. It is ſaid, that a certain Saint of old ſhould wiſh, that he ſhould be of no other uſe unto God, then his own right hand was unto him; which ſeeing it was nothing but an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, aptly to give and receive what was fit, and conſequently arrogateth neither honour nor glory to it ſelfe. And indeed it is meet we all ſhould be ſuch; and becauſe all things come from God to us freely, in like manner we ſhould render all things to our neighbour in ſingle ſimplicity, and without the deſire of vainglory, and praiſe, out of pure love: for unto God alone, as to the author, is honour and glory due; but unto us nothing at all: we are onely inſtruments created and made fit to receive and deliver; which if any be without this ſincere charity, he with all his gifts is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: So I ſay, Although hee ſpeake with
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:65322:152"/> the tongues of Angels, can propheſie, know all myſteries, and all knowledge, and had never ſo much faith, even that it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move mountaines, and give all that he hath to the poore; laſtly, give himſelfe to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <note place="margin">Selfe love and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance was the fall of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. For all ſelfe-love, that is, the deſire of honour, and praiſe, and private profit, is of the Devill, and was his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie by which hee fell from heaven, and for which hee was worthily driven from thence. For when God had created <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> the moſt beautifull Angell, and adorned him with moſt excellent gifts of wiſdome, light, glory, and riches, he began to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire himſelfe in his gifts, as a Peacock doth admire himſelfe, to love, honour, and praiſe himſelfe, which was the firſt ſtep to his ruine, even to give honour to himſelfe, not to God, and to turne his love from God to himſelfe: whereupon he was worthily caſt out of heaven, with all his companions, which his pride by contagion had infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: neither was hee contented with his principality amongſt Angels, according to that of Saint <hi>Jude, The Angels which kept not their principality.</hi> And that of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Coloſſians, chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Spoyling Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi>

                  <note place="margin">And of man.</note> 
                  <hi>and openly triumphing over them in himſelfe.</hi> Now by what ſinne <hi>Lucifer</hi> procured his own ruine, he was the cauſe and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by the ſame ſinne, of the loſſe of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, turning him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the love of the honor of God, to himſelfe; whereby followed ſelf-love and arrogancy, ſuch and ſo great, even to affect the ſimilitude of God, whereby conſequently hee was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe caſt out of Paradiſe, then <hi>Lucifer</hi> out of Heaven, leaving to us all the heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of arrogancy and ſelf-love. And this is the fall and Apoſtaſie of <hi>Adam,</hi> which all men in like manner doe iterate, and with fleſh and bloud give and deliver every one to other the ſame: the means of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and cure whereof, can and ought no other wayes be ſought and obtained, but by the merit of Chriſt apprehended by faith, whereby thenceforth wee are renewed in Chriſt, and our fleſh is crucified, neither now doe we love our ſelves any more, but <note place="margin">Deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> hate our ſelves, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. that is, all our own works doe begin to diſpleaſe us, we do not honour our ſelves, or beare out our ſelves, but deny our ſelves, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. that is, wee
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:65322:153"/> ſet nought by our ſelves; laſtly, we do not now ſeek our ſingular praiſe and glory, but by denying all things that we have, place our pleaſure and truſt in no earthly thing; and likewiſe doe fight and ſtrive with fleſh &amp; bloud our inward enemies, which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath not, nor doth not, as above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, he neither is nor can be the Diſciple of Chriſt, ſeeing by this meanes in ſerious and true repentance, the converſion of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature muſt be changed. Moreover, ſeeing that means is greater then the ſtrength of man, which of it ſelfe, and by its nature, can doe nothing but love it ſelf, favour it ſelfe, and boaſt, and cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare <note place="margin">By the incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Chriſt our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> to ſeek his own ends, or to ſpeak in a word, to ſinne: therefore it behoveth God to be the beginning, middle, and end and prop, the Sonne of God to take the forme of a man upon him, and conſequently to renew our nature, that thereby every one of us being regenerate, by him, in him, and from him, we become a new creature: for even as in <hi>Adam</hi> we were dead bodily and ſpiritually, ſo it behoveth us in Chriſt to riſe and be ſpiritually renewed. Even as by carnall nativity we entred upon the ſin of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:65322:153"/> 
                  <hi>Adam,</hi> as a certain heritage: ſo in Chriſt by a ſpiritual birth and faith wee muſt bee juſtified. Finally, as radically we draw from <hi>Adam</hi> ſinne, ſelfe-love, arrogancy, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; <note place="margin">New-birth is found in Chriſt</note> ſo from Chriſt by faith, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, our nature is to be renewed and ſanctified; all ſelfe-love, arrogancy and ambitition to die in it: and it behoveth us to get a new heart and ſpirit from Chriſt, as we have from <hi>Adam</hi> fleſh ſubject to ſin. And of this new birth Chriſt is called <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eternall, or of the future Age, Iſa. chap.</hi> 9. <note place="margin">The works of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the new birth.</note> Whereupon it followeth conſequently, that all the works of Chriſtians, and gifts which ſhall be acceptable to God, ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the new creature, that is, from faith in Chriſt, and the holy Ghoſt; which if it be not ſo done, whatſoever things, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be moſt excellent gifts, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven miracles themſelves, before God they are void, and to no purpoſe. And towards our neighbour all things ought to be done in charity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. and without hope of proper gain, or honour. For example of which, and a moſt excellent pattern, God Almighty offered, and gave us his Sonne, in whom there was no ſelfe-love, no arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance:
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:65322:154"/> laſtly, no deſire of private profit, or praiſe, or glory, and nothing but ſincere and meere love and humility; neither alſo as other Saints was hee propoſed to us to imitate, becauſe their example was from without, and ſo to behold, or renew; but that hee might by faith live and breath in us: which when it cometh to paſſe, even then all our works, words, and ſo our knowledge doe proceed from Chriſt as from a living foundation and originall; if otherwiſe, then all our works and gifts, if they be Angelicall, or of what kind ſoever, they are nevertheleſſe nothing worth. For where ſelfe-love is, there the hatred of God is; where arrogancy, there the contempt of God, where by no reaſon it can come to paſſe, that works ſpringing from thence, ſhould be acceptable to God. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe this, let us beſeech Almighty God from the bottomes of our hearts, to give us faith and ſincere love, contaminated with no deſire of honour, profit, or glory, but proceeding from a pure heart; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obtained, not onely illuſtrious gifts and works, but the leaſt alſo, even a cup of cold water, will be moſt deare and acceptable to

Therefore, although thou give thy body to be burned, and want love, which is due to God alone, and his praiſes and honour, thou doeſt nothing, ſaith Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> Neither doe they profit any more, which whip and burn their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies <hi>by humbling and afflicting their ſouls,</hi> as ſpeaketh <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58. becauſe indeed they are conceited in their ſingular ſanctity, and affect their own proper praiſes, and their preſumptuous religion, in their private judgement, doe not reſpect God, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, popular praiſe, and eſtimation,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:65322:167"/> whereby many of them are ſo blinded, God ſuffering them <hi>the work of error,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. that they make no doubt to ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be burned for the defence of their <note place="margin">Falſe Martyrs</note> conceived hereſie, and if God be pleaſed, to become Martyrs of Chriſt; when yet they doe not ſerve Chriſt but themſelves, neither doth the puniſhment but the cauſe make a Martyr. Such Martyrs as theſe the Devill even amongſt the Ethnickes hath, many were ſo blinded in their underſtanding, they were contented to die for their Altars and Idols. And the ſame is done this day amongſt Chriſtians, under the ſhew of the Chriſtian faith, ſeeing the Ethnicks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to gain an immortall name, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves they doe well in ſo doing. To whom for ſelf-love and glory, or praiſe, there were like unto them certain Monks, devout perſons in our age, which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Catholicks,</hi> which for the cauſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating Religion, will perſwade Princes and Monarchs, that they are to doe the like unto them, even die for the Catholicks cauſe. Whoſe madneſſe is ſo much the more manifeſt, being they beleeve that they ſuffer for Chriſts cauſe, and they become his
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:65322:167"/> Martrys, when contrariwiſe they become the Martyrs of Roman Biſhops, and of their private renown and praiſe. And thus much of coated or cloak charity, powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeduced and carried on by a falſe light.

               <p>BY this Sentence it appeareth, wee are taught, that no man doth taſte the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſweetneſſe of the heavenly joy and ſolace hidden in the word of God, which doth not overcome his own fleſh, and the <note place="margin">Who be apt to taſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> world, with all the pomps and concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcences thereof, and laſtly, the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; that is to ſay, they who crucifie their own fleſh daily by their ſerious contrition
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:65322:168"/> and repentance, with all the deſires and concupiſcence thereof, who die to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the world daily; laſtly, to whom this life is a meer croſſe: I ſay, theſe are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely fed with heavenly Manna, and drink the Nectar of Paradiſe. Contrariwiſe, thoſe that follow none but worldly pleaſure, it is unprofitable for thoſe to taſte the hidden <note place="margin">Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ioy not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note> Manna. For like things are delighted in their like; and ſeeing that the word of God is ſpirituall, it is no marvell if worldly minds be not delighted therewith. For even as the ſoul receiveth no ſtrength of the food which the ſtomack hath not concocted: ſo the ſoule, of the divine Word, or Manna, receiveth no ſtrength, unleſſe it bee conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into it ſelfe, that is, into life. Yea, as a man ſick of a Fever diſtaſteth all things, and are bitter unto him: ſo thoſe that are ſick of the worldly Ague, that is, of the love of the world, covetouſneſſe, pride, and luſt; theſe, I ſay, doe loath the word of God, and diſtaſt it as bitter. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <note place="margin">With whom the word of God hath no ſavour.</note> thoſe that have the Spirit of God, theſe doe find in it the hidden Manna, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be taſted by them that are carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the world: which is the cauſe that
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:65322:169"/> many by the daily hearing of the Goſpel, doe feele little deſire and ſpirituall joy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not carried by the Spirit of God, nor have any heavenly (but earthly) minds. But he that will fully and ſoundly underſtand the word of God, and eate Manna, it behoveth him to ſtudy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all his life to it and Chriſt. Which being done, hee feedeth the humble with grace, comforteth the meek, and maketh his yoak pleaſant, and his burden light unto them. For the ſweetneſſe of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Manna cannot bee taſted but under the yoak of Chriſt; according to that, <hi>Hee will fill the hungry with good things, and ſend the rich empty away. The words that I have ſpoken, are ſpirit and life,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6. Whereupon it followeth, a voluptuous heart and carnall, that is, a man that hath no ſpirituall underſtanding, cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly underſtand thoſe things. For in ſpirit, in reſt, in ſilence, with great humility, &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vehement deſire, is the word of God to bee received; which if it be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into life, then truly it is no better then the external letter, and a ſound of words. Even as he that heareth the noyſe
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:65322:169"/> of a Harp onely, or a Song, and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it not, receiveth no pleaſure by it: ſo no man is partaker of the virtue that is in the Word, unleſſe he endeavour to expreſſe it in his life. And this is that which was ſaid before out of <hi>John: I will give thee a white ſtone, and in the ſtone a new name writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, which no man knoweth, but hee that hath</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hee which clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to the Lord.</note> 
                  <hi>it.</hi> This is that, I ſay, even <hi>a teſtimony of the hidden ſpirit which hee giveth to the word of God, Rom.</hi> 8. And in like manner, the Spirit of the Word giveth teſtimony to our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whereby both doe conſpire and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent together, and ſo become one ſpirit, which is that <hi>New Name</hi> unknown but to <note place="margin">A new name.</note> the receiver. For as no man knoweth the ſweetneſſe of hony, but he that taſteth it; ſo the name of the teſtimony divine in the hearts of men, no man knoweth but hee that proveth it. This man onely knoweth the conſolations and divine viſitations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he perceiveth them: whoſe name is alſo called <hi>New,</hi> becauſe they are the works and fruits of the new birth. Bleſſed is the man to whom God hath given himſelf to be ſo taſted in his heart! Bleſſed are the Prophets whom from the beginning of the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:65322:170"/> world he hath fed with his bread ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, and by the conference of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall word: which becauſe it was ſo done unto them, therefore out of ſenſe, feeling, and experience, they have ſpoken of it, and compoſed holy Scripture. And in truth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all this day he ſpeaketh unto all men, and feedeth them inwardly with his word in the ſoule: but almoſt all men have ſhut their eares againſt his voice, and had rather <note place="margin">The living word is meat of the ſoul</note> heare the world then God, and be driven by their own concupiſcences, then by the Spirit of God. Whereupon it cometh to paſſe, that they cannot taſt the hidden Manna, ſwallowing up in the mean time both apples of the tree of death, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall concupiſcences, contemning the tree of life. Which men are not a little mad, whilſt they can underſtand that God can give greater pleaſures to his lovers then the world: ſo that he that hath once taſted the goodneſſe of God, to him the whole world, with all the pleaſures, they will ſeem <note place="margin">The tree of death.</note> to him as meer gall and bitterneſſe. Now ſeeing we know our firſt progenitors were beguiled with the world, and by eating of the forbidden tree have acquired death,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:65322:170"/> yet we are ſo blind and mad, as fed with eternall death of carnall pleaſures ſo dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bought wee may remember. <hi>If any ſhall eat of me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt the true tree of life, and true bread of life, <hi>he ſhall live for ever, John</hi> 6. And what is it to eat of it, but to beleeve in him, in him to joy and take delight; laſtly, to reſt and take pleaſure in him alone? Great therefore, O mortals, is the carnall blindneſſe, to ſerve the world for trifles, vain and fraile things with ſuch affection and deſires, and not to doe the ſame to God, who rewardeth his worſhip and ſervice with eternall things, and farre more noble goods. For who performeth to God ſo much and ſo great faith, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and diligence, as the vulgar we ſee doe perform to Mammon and the World? We ſee them many times for ſmall matters, or a little mony, make journies: and for heavens cauſe it grieveth us to move a foot. Hereupon the holy Prophets reproach <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> with emphaticall upbraids for taking in hand moſt vaſt and ſea journies for the advance of their earthly cauſes, when in the mean time they would not deigne for the ſoveraigne good to change
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:65322:171"/> their place. And in our time men of all ſorts and conditions doe prefer the world before God, it is a thing moſt manifeſt. <note place="margin">The ſons of the world.</note> Thereupon we ſee many Doctors doe ſtudy day and night to attain to honour in the world, who hardly or not at all wil take ſo much leaſure as ſufficeth to ſay the Lords prayer, if they might attain eternal honours and dignities celeſtial with ſo little la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Therefore you ſee the ſame men to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd no labour in warfare to attaine to fame and honour, and yet will not enter combat with their own vices, although they may attain heavenly nobility thereby. Therefore you ſhall likewiſe ſee that the Lords and Victors of many Nations and vaſt Kingdomes, doe not care for over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming themſelves: laſtly, that infinite many doe not regard the loſſe of their ſoule and eternall happineſſe, to attaine to fraile and momentany goods. And all theſe have not <note place="margin">The true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</note> taſted the <hi>Hidden Manna</hi> of the divine Word, and therefore doe not overcome the world, but are overcome of the world. Which whoſoever dare contemne in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God, he truly finds the moſt ſweet viſits of the holy Ghoſt, and is filled with
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:65322:171"/> the heavenly pleaſure which no man <note place="margin">The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſweetnes is taſted when the world is deſpiſed</note> knoweth but hee that receiveth it. This therefore is to be done, the tree of life is firſt to bee planted in us, that wee may eat the fruit thereof: and our heart that wiſheth to be recreated with the celeſtiall conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ought firſt to bee converted from the world to God; but wee being made drunk with worldly pleaſures, and bewitched, do not incline our hearts and minds to think that heavenly joyes, and thoſe of God are rather to be wiſhed, then thoſe which the world offereth or affordeth. Although truly that is more true that God offereth and doth, and are more noble then that which the creatures doe bring to paſſe. Wherfore the learning which cometh from above by the inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt, <note place="margin">True conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and wiſdom is of God.</note> is much more excellent then that other which humane underſtanding with great labour doth obtain. For even as an Apple or a Lilly produced by nature, is far more noble and much better then that which a workman maketh of gold, be the gold ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo fine: ſo one drop of conſolation di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, <note place="margin">The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of worldly ioy.</note> is more noble, and by many, yea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite parts better then a whole Ocean of
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:65322:172"/> wordly pleaſures. Which truly are to bee ſlighted by him that deſireth divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations.

Thoſe that are fatuated with the meer love of the world, doe preferre this our Age, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned and wiſe before all antiquitie: theſe, I ſay, doe not know the Art of Arts, that is, the divine love more noble then all knowledge to be extinct wholly together with the faith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. and few to remain divinely learned, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5. and that have learned of Chriſt a humble and lowly life, <hi>Matthew</hi> 11. yea to ſpeake the truth, the moſt learned for the moſt part, are void of divine love, and therefore doe not know at all that the true life is in Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. Theſe therefore doe circumſcribe knowledge in the circle of words, when it is more true, that ſolid learning is a thing and not words, and to conſiſt in eternall and true wiſdome: of which we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more at large in the Treatiſe of ancient Philoſophy. But if any ſhall ſay that this our Age is wicked, he truly ſhal ſay that which is agreeable to the truth, and to the word of God.

                  <q>God is light, and there is no darkneſſe in him, if we ſhall ſay we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſſe, we doe lie, and are not in the truth: But if wee walk in the truth, even as he is in the truth, we have joynt fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with him.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THat we may underſtand the nature of Light and Darkneſſe, it is neceſſary to ſeek into the definition of Light; which no man can give a better then that which bleſſed <hi>John</hi> himſelfe delivereth. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is light.</hi> And what is God? A ſpiritual
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:65322:176"/> being, eternal, infinite, almighty, merciful, gentle, juſt, holy, true, all-knowing; laſtly, of love and faith ineffable; God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet, the Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, one in eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, three in perſons, the chiefe and all good eſſentially. And this is the true and eternall light, whence every one from <note place="margin">True light &amp; true darknes.</note> God and his love, mercy, juſtice, and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, turneth himſelfe when it is evident hee paſſeth from light to darknes, ſeeing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God there is nothing but darkneſſe. For if he be light, it followeth contrariwiſe that the Devil is darkneſſe it ſelfe: if he be charity, the Devil is nothing but wrath, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, hatred, ſinne and torment, it muſt needs be ſo. To which whoſoever joyneth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he is changed to darkneſſe and the Devil, from which he is not delivered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhall convert himſelfe from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to light, from ſinne to righteouſneſſe; and laſtly, from the Devil to God. That which is the work of faith alone, <hi>by which our hearts are purified, Acts</hi> 15. For whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever beleeveth in Chriſt, he repenteth dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and converteth himſelf from ſinne, that is, from the Devil to Chriſt. For as <hi>Adam</hi> by ſinne converted himſelfe from God to
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:65322:177"/> the Devil; ſo it behoveth every one of us to flye by true repentance and remiſſion of ſinnes, from the Devil to God. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it followeth, that man without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning and converſion to God, cannot be inlightned. <hi>For what fellowſhip hath ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice with unrighteouſneſſe, or what place of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety is there for light and darkneſſe?</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. This darkneſſe is unrighteouſneſſe, but the light is the true knowledge of Chriſt, which can no wayes enter into fellowſhip: ſo that it is impoſſible that thoſe ſhould be inlightned by the Spirit and light of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>be taken away;</hi> that is, darkneſſe, blindneſſe, and ignorance ſhal ceaſe, Chriſt ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten them. For what greater blindneſſe, or thicker miſt can cover the minds of men, then infidelity, with the fruit thereof, as pride, covetouſneſſe, wrath, luſt; therefore where they be, it cannot come to paſſe that a man ſhould acknowledge Chriſt the moſt true light, until hee beleeve in him, confide in him, and bee ſaved by him. For how
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:65322:177"/> ſhal he underſtand the humility of Chriſt, whoſe mind knoweth not himſelf through pride? How ſhould he know his meeknes, that is altogether full of wrath and envie? How his exceeding wonderfull patience, which rejoyceth in revenge, and imitateth <note place="margin">The true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt.</note> the brute beaſt in cruelty? For whoſoever underſtandeth not the lowlineſſe, humility, and patience of Chriſt, hee never knoweth Chriſt in his faith. And that you may truly and rightly know him, it behoveth thee by faith to have the heart &amp; underſtanding of Chriſt, and to perceive his lowlineſſe, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and humility within thee in thy heart. For as a plant is known by the taſt and ſmell: ſo Chriſt which is the tree of life, by taſting and by triall, is underſtood: I ſay, by taſting in faith his lowlineſſe, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and patience, and by eating of his fruit, whereby conſequently his ſoule might find reſt and tranquillity, and be made capable of divine grace and conſolation. Which two into a heart void of faith, and unfen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with the humility and lowlineſſe of Chriſt, cannot enter to fructifie, ſeeing that God giveth grace only to the humble. Seeing then it is thus, what doth Chriſt
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:65322:178"/> profit a man who hath no ſociety with him? Such are all thoſe who living in the darkneſſe of ſinne, cannot be compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of light, according to that of Saint <hi>John, If we ſay we have ſociety with him, and walk in darkneſſe, we are liers, and want the truth. But if we walk in the light as hee is in the light, we have joynt fellowſhip with him.</hi> Which in the ſecond chapter hee addeth, <hi>The darkneſſc is paſſed over, and the true light now ſhineth: h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e which ſaith hee is in the light and hateth his brother, is in darkneſſe untill now. He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is no offence in him. But he that hateth his brother is in darkneſſe, and walketh in darkneſſe, and knoweth not whither he goeth, becauſe darkneſſe hath blinded his eyes.</hi> And how long a man remaineth in that terrible cloud of ſinnes, he cannot bee lightned of Chriſt, which is the true Light, and come to the knowledge of God. For the true knowledge of God and Chriſt conſiſteth in that hee underſtands God to be meere <note place="margin">The true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt.</note> Grace and Charity: which who hath not and exerciſeth, this man knoweth it with the moſt ignorant. So all knowledge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth, &amp; ariſeth out of the underſtanding,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:65322:178"/> experience, and works of truth: and ſo certain it is, that hee which doth not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe charity; howſoever hee make many words of it, yet he perceiveth not the perfect nature of it. In like manner, Chriſt is meere love, humility, meekneſſe, patience, and vertue: the which who hath not, is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of Chriſt, although hee can prattle many things of him, and uſurp his name.</p>
               <p>After the ſame manner, the word of God is nothing but Spirit: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they which live not in the Spirit, theſe conſequently doe not know what the word of God is, although they fable and diſpute of it every where. Therefore it belongeth not to him to judge of love, who never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth it. For all knowledge, as we ſaid even now, beginneth with feeling &amp; expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. <note place="margin">Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ariſeth out of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> Nor is it his part to ſpeak of the light that never moved a foot out of his own darkneſſe to ſee the light: and what is light in man but faith and charity, according to the ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in heaven.</hi> Now ſeeing that the moſt holy life of Chriſt is nothing but meer love, if
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:65322:179"/> we endeavour to drink and draw from him true faith, humility, lowlineſſe, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as it is given in commandement to us by the ſevere Law of Learning, then truly we are transformed into his image, and we are beautified and adorned with his love no otherwiſe then if we were covered with Chriſt himſelfe, which is the eternal and true Light, according to that of the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, chap.</hi> 5. <hi>Ariſe thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt will inlighten thee.</hi> Whereupon it followeth again, that as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as doe not awake from the ſleep of the world, that is, concupiſeence of the eyes, of the fleſh, and pride of life, their ſoule can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not truly be illuminated by Chriſt. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, they which aſſume the life of Chriſt, and follow him in faith, theſe tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are illuminated, according to that of Saint <hi>John, chap.</hi> 8. <hi>I am the light of the world, he which followeth me,</hi> in faith, charity, hope, patience, lowlineſſe, humility, feare of <note place="margin">Onely the mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyrs of Chriſt illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated.</note> God, and prayer, <hi>walketh not in darkneſſe, but ſhall have the light of life.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay: Onely thoſe that imitate me, have the light of life, and the <hi>true illumination</hi> and <hi>knowledge</hi> of mee. By reaſon of the ſame

Which if it flye the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, it is plain that they cannot be inlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of it. To which that is like, that Chriſt <hi>denieth the world,</hi> that is, carnal minds not repenting them at all, <hi>can they receive the holy Ghoſt.</hi> But that there might be a perfect and abſolute example amongſt men, and an Idea of vertue, therefore the Son of God became Man, and by his moſt holy life, became the publick Light of the world; that all men might follow him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in him, and be illuminated from him. Now ſeeing the falſe Chriſtians themſelves know not Chriſt to be the moſt perfect and abſolute righteouſneſſe, or vertue, therefore
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:65322:180"/> they did not care for following him, it is manifeſt that the Ethnicks, the moſt rigid obſervers &amp; lovers of vertue, did goe far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them. Of whom the wiſeſt, as <hi>Plato, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle, Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> determined: <hi>If the virtue of the body may be ſeen, or could bee ſeen, it would appeare more cleare then Lucifer, or the day ſtarre.</hi> But thoſe that ſhal behold Chriſt with the eye of faith, he being the true <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer,</hi> or Day-ſtar, doth far excel them, and <note place="margin">Faith in Chriſt illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateth the heart.</note> thoſe ſhall ſo <hi>ſee and contract the word of life,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.

               <p>SEing it is certain that Chriſt, together with faith and a Chriſtian life, is denied, renounced, and wholly extirpated, to what end ſerveth his doctrine to us? which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

And as from noble ſeed doth ariſe or grow noble fruit: ſo from the Word and Sacraments, ſhould ariſe a new man, holy and ſpiritual, and to ſpeak in a word, a Chriſtian, out of the Spirit, Word, and Sacrament, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then a man regenerate out of Chriſt, ſo beleeving in him, and living in him. For as an infant is born of his mother, ſo a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is born of God and Chriſt by faith. But when wee have not determined to change our life, nay rather have ſo framed our manners, as they are againſt him, it is plain we are not begotten of God, and therefore his doctrine and light doth profit us nothing when we are ſure wee walke in darkneſſe. Whereupon alſo the light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fled and taken away, it muſt needs bee that darkneſſe and falſe doctrine of errors and ſeducing, do incroach upon us. Which to beware of, our Saviour did admoniſh us ſaying, <hi>Little children, whilſt yee have light, walk in it, leſt darkneſſe doe comprehend you;</hi> I ſay, the darkneſſe of errors, deceivers, deluding, of blindneſſe and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

And this hardneſſe of heart is that terrible darkneſſe which in the end overtaketh thoſe that will not walk in the light, and is the puniſhment of thoſe that blaſpheme the truth, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. <hi>Who is the Lord that I ſhould heare</hi>

Or what is more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing and unreconcileable then an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure life, and pure doctrine? Wherefore if we will retain doctrine, the way we hold, is wholly to bee changed, is utterly to bee changed by publicke ſuffrage of cuſtome and applauſe, and it muſt be altered for a better then Antichriſtian, we muſt imitate
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:65322:188"/> Chriſt, and ſhake off the ſleep of ſinne, and <note place="margin">He that keepeth not the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of Chriſt, ſtrayeth from the way</note> Chriſt will beautifie us with the light of true faith.

               <p>THe purity of Doctrine, and the verity of Chriſtian faith come to be defended againſt Sects and Hereſies: after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Prophets which preached againſt <note place="margin">The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> falſe and idolatrous Prophets in the old Teſtament: after the example of the Sonne of God, who diſputed vehemently againſt the Phariſees and Scribes; after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, who wrote his
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:65322:189"/> Goſpel againſt <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinth,</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> againſt the falſe Church of the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> and others: after the example of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who defended moſt ſtrongly the doctrine of juſtification by faith, of good works, of the reſurrection of the dead, of Chriſtian liberty and ſuch like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt falſe Apoſtles: after the example of the holy Biſhops and Fathers of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, which wrote moſt ſtrongly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pagan ſuperſtitions, and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, and in the Oecumenical Councels gathered by the Chriſtian Emperours, did condemne the chiefe Heretickes and Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, Arrians, Macedonians, Neſtorians, and Eutychians: laſtly, by the example of the incomparable Heroe <hi>Martin Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> by whoſe excellent and grave wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings the Papality and other Hereticks were much weakened, it is as cleare as the noon-day. Therefore it remaineth as a thing moſt fit and requiſite, to preach, write and diſpute, that the purity of the doctrine, and the verity of religion might bee mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, according to the Apoſtle, who in the firſt chapter to <hi>Titus</hi> will have a <hi>Biſhop to be powerfull to exhort in doctrine that is ſound,</hi>
                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:65322:190"/> 
                  <hi>and to argue with thoſe that contradict it.</hi> The <note place="margin">The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of Then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> which although it be a lawful and a lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way, it is ſo faln out by the abuſe of it, that amongſt all their bitter Diſputations and Sermons of controverſies, and the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite heaps of writing, and counterwriting, the memory of Chriſtian life, of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, devotion and charity, is almoſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed with their names, no otherwiſe then if the ſumme of Chriſtian Religion conſiſted in diſputation, and writing books of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troverſies, &amp; not in the practice of the Goſpel, and Chriſtian learning. For if we behold the examples of the holy Prophets and Apoſtles, as alſo of the Sonne of God, it is manifeſt that they did ſharply diſpute not onely againſt falſe Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but alſo againſt the ſuperſtitions of the Gentiles; but with no leſſe fervency did exhort to repentance &amp; Chriſtian life; and moreover did ſhew in moſt grave Sermons, that by their impenitency and wicked life, the divine Worſhip and Religion did goe backwards, and decay, the Church was waſted, that Kingdome and people were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with hunger, warre, and plague; all which came to paſſe as true as they
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:65322:190"/> ſaid it. Of this kind is that Sermon of <hi>Eſay,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Impiery deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the worſhip of God, &amp; true religion.</note> 
                  <hi>chap.</hi> 5. where he denounceth to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Jewes, <hi>becauſe the vineyard of the Lord did not bring forth cluſters of grapes, but wild grapes, therefore Almighty God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to lay it waſt.</hi> Whereby it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that impiety is the cauſe why God uſeth to take his word from us. To the ſame ſenſe is that which Chriſt ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 12. <hi>Walk in the light whilſt you have it, leſt darkneſſe overtake you.</hi> For what other thing is it to walk in the light, then to imitate Chriſt? Or what other thing is it to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken with darkneſſe, then to loſe the purity of the Goſpel? Whereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <note place="margin">without true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce none is enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> that none can without true repentance and a holy life, enjoy the light: the holy Ghoſt, which is the true enlightner of our hearts, flying the ungodly, and chuſing holy ſoules onely to make friends and Prophets of God, as it is written <hi>Wiſdom</hi> 7. <hi>whoſe beginning ſith the fear of God is,</hi> as it is in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 111. who likewiſe doubteth impiety to be the beginning of folly, ignorance and blindneſſe? Moreover, the true knowledge of Chriſt, and pure doctrine, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion thereof, doth not conſiſt in words
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:65322:191"/> onely, but in deed and holy life, according <note place="margin">The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt conſiſts not in words.</note> to that of <hi>Titus, chap.</hi> 1. <hi>They confeſſe they know God, but deny him in their deeds, when they are abominable and unbeleevers and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates to every good work.</hi> And <hi>Titus</hi> 3. <hi>They have the ſhew of godlineſſe, but deny the virtue thereof.</hi> Whereby it is given to underſtand, that Chriſt and his Word is denied by a wicked life as wel as words; neither hath he the true knowledge of Chriſt which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver putteth it into action. Wherefore he that never feeleth or taſteth the humility, low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, <note place="margin">It is lame without a holy life.</note> patience, and the love of Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in his heart, hee knoweth not Chriſt, and therefore where uſe and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty requireth, they cannot confeſſe him. For to profeſſe &amp; preach the doctrine of Chriſt onely, is truly to divide Chriſt, and to lame him, if you do not profeſſe and preach <note place="margin">It is not words, but life that makes a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</note> his life. And we have abundance of books of his doctrine; of his life almoſt none; every where bookes of controverſies concerning doctrine, but very little time ſpent about true repentance and a Chriſtian life. For what is doctrine without life, but a tree without fruit? Or how ſhould he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the doctrine of Chriſt who imitateth
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:65322:191"/> not his life? For the head or chiefe of the doctrine of Chriſt <hi>is charity from a pure heart and a good conſcience, and an unfained faith.</hi> But we live in that age wherein there is a great number of thoſe whom if wee heare them diſputing ſo acutely and well of the doctrine of Chriſtian religion, you would think them to be men of great worth; but if you behold them narrowly, and touch them neerly, you ſhall then know them to bee inwardly and in their hearts full of pride, envie, and covetouſneſſe, that no Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilisk can be more venemous. Againſt whom therefore wee muſt beware, obſerve what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. he doth not raſhly or ſuddenly joyn Love and Faith, that hee may ſhew that theſe two do or would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire and conſent together. And although wee cannot arrogate ſo much to our ſtrength and piety, that wee make it the price of our happineſſe, knowing alſo with Saint <hi>Peter, Epiſt.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>that wee are kept in the virtue of God by faith to ſalvation:</hi> yet we profeſſe this, that by an Antichriſtian life the Spirit of God will avoyd us with all <note place="margin">The wic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked are not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned</note> his gifts, amongſt which faith, knowledge, underſtanding and wiſdome are not the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:65322:192"/> leaſt. Whereby it followeth again, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a holy life the purity of doctrine can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be preſerved; and the wicked which will not imitate Chriſt, are not enlightned with the true light. On the contrary, thoſe that walk in the light, that is, which doe inſiſt and perſevere in the footſteps of Chriſt, are drenched and bathed in the true light, which is Chriſt, and divinely preſerved from all errors. Therefore it is true which that ancient Writer <hi>Taule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> ſaith, <hi>So ſoon as a man dedicateth himſelfe to God, and ſuffereth him, and denieth his own will and fleſh, then truly the Spirit of God doth begin to make beginning of illumination, and endowing with true and ſolid knowledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe indeed this man doth celebrate the true Sabbath of the heart, and keepeth holy day, and reſteth from his wicked concupiſcences, will and works.</hi> Which is to be taken of the ſtate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter converſion, and of daily illumination, and of the increaſe of gifts and ſpirituall grace. Now neither is it unfitly ſaid which Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 14. ſpeaketh, <hi>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life;</hi> calling himſelfe the <hi>Way,</hi> who ſheweth the ſame unto us, not <note place="margin">How Chriſt is the way.</note> onely in doctrine, but in his moſt holy life.
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:65322:192"/> Which life is no other thing then a living faith, and working by love, hope, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, meekneſſe, humility, prayer, the feare of the Lord, and to ſpeak in a word, true repentance &amp; turning to God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are drawn to the <hi>Truth</hi> and the <hi>Life,</hi> wherein the whole Chriſtianity doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, which is the breviary or epitome of all bookes and precepts. Which is alſo the true and Kingly way to life and truth, and is Chriſt himſelfe, the book of life, in the involving and learning whereof wee ought <note place="margin">Chriſt is our book.</note> to ſpend all our life. This (I ſay) is that <hi>ſtrait way and narrow gate, Matth.</hi> 7. <hi>which few doe find;</hi> this is the book of life which almoſt none doe reade, although in it all things are contained which a Chriſtian ought to know: ſo that wee ſhall need no other book to our eternall ſalvation. Which is the reaſon why alſo the holy Scripture is contained in very few bookes, to wit, that it might appeare that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity did not conſiſt in the multitude of <note place="margin">The bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</note> Commentaries and great Volumes, but in living faith, and imitation of Chriſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of <hi>Eccleſ. c.</hi> 12. <hi>There is no end of making many books, and much meditation of</hi>
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:65322:193"/> 
                  <hi>the fleſh is affliction. In like maner let us all hear the end of ſpeaking, Fear God and keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</hi> Moreover, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. it is ſaid, <hi>That the Devill when men are aſleep ſoweth Tares in the Wheat:</hi> that teacheth us, when men neglect repentance, and ſleep ſoundly in their ſinnes, and are overtaken with the love of this world, we having more care of frail things then immortall goods, then by little and little doth the Devil ſprinkle his <note place="margin">Pride is the field of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.</note> ſeed of falſe doctrine in the field of pride; whereupon doe ariſe Sects and Hereſies: for by pride both Men and Angels loſt the true light; and all errors came into the world, which yet we might have wanted if Satan and <hi>Adam</hi> had lived in the humble life of Chriſt. Whereupon Saint <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. ſaith, <hi>Ariſe thou that ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, and Chriſt ſhall inlighten thee,</hi> being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſhew that no man can bee divinely enlightned, who hath not before ſhaken off from his eyes the ſleep of ſinne, and driven from him ſecurity and impiety, according to that of the <hi>Acts, chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Repent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the gift of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And that of <hi>John, chap.</hi> 17. <hi>The world cannot receive the holy Ghoſt:</hi> underſtanding by the world, a
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:65322:193"/> wicked and worldly life. Likewiſe when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>You know them by their fruits,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">All things are known by the fruits.</note> what other thing ſignifieth it, then not <hi>O Lord, Lord,</hi> but the fruits of life is the ſigne and mark of true and falſe Chriſtians? For what belongeth the pure doctrine to thoſe falſe Chriſtians uſe, who under pretext of ſheeps cloathing doe make ſhew, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly they are nothing leſs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. And although the life be corrupt, yet it ſhould not, or may not bee drawn into the argument of falſe and wicked doctrine, as the Papiſts do at this day, eſteeming and condemning our doctrine by the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our lives (which way of arguing if it were worth any thing, now the doctrine of Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles had not been ſound, becauſe even then many falſe Chriſtians were found) but it is yet and will be a ſhew and mark of the men themſelves whereby <note place="margin">The life is the mark of a man.</note> wee may know whether they bee true or falſe Chriſtians; he that teacheth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe teacheth otherwiſe then he liveth, and when he beleeveth aright, he doth blot his faith with an Antichriſtian life, as if Ivory were ſpotted with Ink. In which ſenſe ſo many as are ſo, Chriſt calleth them falſe
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:65322:194"/> Chriſtians, unfruitfull trees, fit for nothing but to be burned; laſtly, that onely is true and Chriſtian faith, which worketh by love, by which a man is made or becometh a new creature, by which he is regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by which he is united with God, by which Chriſt liveth in us, dwelleth and worketh in us, by which the kingdome of God is built in us; and laſtly, by which the holy Ghoſt purgeth and enlightneth our hearts. To which doe belong many golden Oracles of holy Scripture, ſuch as that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>He that cleaveth to the Lord is ſpirit.</hi> And what is it to have the Spirit of Chriſt, and to breath with it, then to have the ſame underſtanding and mind, and the ſame heart? which joynt breathing and conſent, is nothing elſe but a new, holy, noble, heavenly, ſpirituall, and heroicall life of Chriſt in us. Alſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>In Chriſt is a new creature,</hi> terming to bee in Chriſt, not onely to beleeve in him, but to live in him. Alſo <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2. <hi>I will eſpouſe thee to me for</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſing of Chriſt and its fruit.</note> 
                  <hi>ever, in faith I will ſpouſe thee to me.</hi> Which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſignifie nothing elſe then that a man wholly and ſpiritually is to bee united to Chriſt; ſo that where faith is, there is
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:65322:194"/> Chriſt; where Chriſt is, there his life is in man; where the life of Chriſt is, there is love; where love is; there is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (for <hi>God is love)</hi> and the holy Ghoſt remaineth. For all things are connexed and chained together; they cleave toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no otherwiſe then the head with the members, and the cauſe with the effect. Which connexion of faith and life, bleſſed <note place="margin">The chain of vertue.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter, Epiſt.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 1. repreſenting to us, writeth thus: <hi>But of all have eſpeciall care, adde virtue to your faith, and in virtue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and in knowledge abſtinence, and in abſtinence patience, and in patience piety, and in piety brotherly love, and in brotherly love charity. For if you have theſe things and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound therein, you ſhall not bee empty, nor bee without fruit in the knowledge of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. But for thoſe that have not theſe things, thoſe are blind and hand-bound, being forgetfull of the purging of their old ſinnes.</hi> In which place the Apoſtle eloquently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth in whom this conjoyning of faith and life is not, when to bee ignorant of Chriſt, to fall from faith, and to walk in darkneſſe. For it is the property of true <note place="margin">True faith.</note> faith to change a man wholly, to renew
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:65322:195"/> him and to quicken him in Chriſt, ſo that hee may live and remain in Chriſt, and Chriſt likewiſe in him.</p>

If thou canſt not bring great offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of devotion, prayer, and thankſgiving to God, offer to him that thou haſt, and canſt, commending and adorning thy ſmal ſacrifices with good wil and holy deſires, that thy religion and devotion may become acceptable before God: becauſe to have even that pious deſire, or be willing to have, is no ſmal grace, and moſt acceptable ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to God; becauſe ſo much as we wiſh to perform before him of devotion, prayer, praiſes, and deſire of heavenly things, even ſo much it is before God. For he requireth nothing of thee but that his grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour may worke in thee, neither canſt thou return him any more then he hath firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on thee.

Even as Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples otherwiſe of no great value or price, if they bee placed in golden Scutcheons, or Sockets, are more excellent and beautifull then themſelves: ſo our prayers, our piety, and thankſgiving in Chriſt, is more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,

               <p>IN the true knowledge of Chriſt, and of his perſon, offices, benefits, and heavenly gifts, doth conſiſt the bleſſed life; which the H.

<pb n="376" facs="tcp:65322:202"/> daily augmented in ſtature and growth. For even as righteouſneſſe is given to a man by faith in Chriſt, and then hee beginneth his converſion or regeneration, or to bee begotten in his converſion, and daily to be renewed after the Image of God; neither is he by and by a man, but is an infant, whom afterwards the holy Ghoſt doth nouriſh, and from day to day doth more and more conform him to Jeſus Chriſt. For the whole life of a Chriſtian man upon this earth, <note place="margin">What Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity is.</note> ought to be nothing elſe then a reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the image of God, ſo that hee might live continually in the new birth, and on the contrary mortifie the old man daily. Which manner of life is onely begun in this world, and perfected in the world to come. Therefore he that before the day of the laſt judgement, and ſo of his death, hath not made his beginning, in this man the Image of God ſhal never be erected to all eternity. Wherefore I hold it very needfull forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to inculcate and inform what is the Image of God, and alſo what the Image of Satan is, ſeeing that in the knowledge of theſe, the whole Chriſtian religion conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and from this one head many other

Therefore the ſoul of man is an immortall ſpirit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by God with excellent powers and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, as underſtanding, will, memory, and other motions and affections of the mind. And this ought to be turned to God, &amp; in him to be made the image of God; ſo <note place="margin">The ſoul of man is the glaſs of God.</note> that as the object in a glaſſe, ſo in it God may be manifeſted and made conſpicuous.

In brief, the whole man both in mind and body, was perfect, holy, juſt, and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God every way. For as the man was the image of God, it followeth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily that the body it ſelf be holy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to God, according to bleſſed <hi>Paul,</hi> who commanded to ſanctifie the body, ſoule, and ſpirit together. For ſeeing that the man conſiſteth of ſoule and body, and therefore bodily and ſpiritual functions going together, it is neceſſary that a ſoule holy and juſt, accompliſhing its workes through the body, and in the body, ſhould have an obſervant inſtrument and equally holy as it ſelfe. Therefore as the ſoule did burn; or was zealous in the moſt pure love of God, ſo all the faculties of the body did imitate the ſame geſture in the love of God and his neighbour. As the ſoule was all mercifull, ſo the body with all the powers
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:65322:204"/> thereof, did incline to clemency. As in the divine ſoul chaſtity did ſhine, ſo all the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, with all internall and externall ſenſes and powers, did uſe perfect purity and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity. In brief, the perfections of virtues were conſpicuous no leſſe in the body then in the mind or ſoul. Wherefore it was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie <note place="margin">What heart ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> for a man in the ſtate of innocencie to love God with all his heart, with all his ſoule, and all his ſtrength, and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as himſelfe. Hereupon it is, that when Almighty God requireth the heart of man, the whole man as concerning body, ſoule, and all his ſtrength, is to be underſtood. In which ſenſe the name of heart in Scripture is underſtood every where; ſo that with it doe come all the ſtrength of the ſoul, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> it were the nerves, the underſtanding, memory, affections and deſires. Neither is it for other reaſons when God requireth the ſoule, underſtanding by that denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation the whole man, ſo much as in him is: which indeed is to bee conformed to <note place="margin">Iuſtice, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and ioy, cleave toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> him, to bee renewed in Chriſt, and that he ought to walk in ſpirit, or in a new and ſpirituall life. But the perfection of moſt ſincere joy doth accompany the perfection
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:65322:204"/> of holineſſe, righteouſneſſe, and love in the man wherewith he was moſt ſincerely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; God ſo diſpoſing it, that where di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine holineſſe is, there alſo ſhould be divine joy: which two, as they cannot be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo they make the Image of God. But we who in this life doe attain to onely an unperfect and begun righteouſneſſe of God and his holineſſe, for theſe beginnings of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt living in all the faithfull, if we be devout, if we be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in the Kingdome of God, we ſhal &amp; do participate thereof in this world, and have the fruits thereof, even the firſt fruits of that heavenly joy. Therefore how much every Chriſtian profiteth in love, ſo much divine pleaſure and joy hee doth find in himſelfe. Which holy and divine love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in that day it ſhal receive the laſt hand and its perfection, therefore alſo our joy ſhall be then perfect, Chriſt bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>John</hi> 16.

Where, what wee have commented of the Image of God, thoſe are no conjectures, but things indeed: neither can it be denied of the moſt perverſe, that Almighty God created man that he might be his moſt cleare looking-glaſſe, ſo that if one were deſirous to know the nature of God, he might look back to himſelfe, and counſell with himſelfe, contemplate God in himſelfe, as in a glaſſe might ſee his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage

Whereby there is to be noted, the neceſſity of the new birth, and renovation, if we will put out the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Devill, oppoſite to the divine law. For as the Devill doth hate God with all his heart; ſo hath hee taught the humane ſoule, againſt God in hoſtile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to behave it ſelfe, not to love him, not to honour him, not to call upon him, to be againſt, and to flye from him. As the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill liveth thus day by day in blindneſſe, little caring what is the Divine will; ſo all things bewitched by him, ſpend the time unmindfull of God and his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; which miſt and night of humane mind, is a horrible and terrible deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the light, and of the image of God, and alſo abominable ſin, whereby the man is ſo farre ſlided back, that hee doth ſay, <hi>There is no God, Pſalm</hi> 14. And for this blindneſſe all humane kind is abomination and accurſed before Almighty God. And although there bee and remain in man a certain ſpark of naturall light, by the force
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:65322:210"/> thereof he underſtandeth ſome God to be, and that he is juſt, as the Ethnick Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers doe teach; yet the ſpirituall life, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God and his righteouſneſſe, is <note place="margin">A ſpark of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral light remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For the conſcience, which is the Law of God writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the heart of man in the creation, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth what is good, whereby there is no man ſo brutiſh in his pleaſures, but by that conſcience he thinketh there is a God, and that he is moved with no motion, but is chaſt, and therefore it cannot but that hee abhorreth all filthineſſe, neither ſhould hee doe otherwiſe. But this good and right thought and ſpark, our light is put out by the filthy pleaſures of the body, and the concupiſcences thereof, no other wayes then if water were caſt upon it. After the ſame manner a ſlanderer or an homicide ſometime reaſoneth with himſelfe; Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there is a God that wil not that men ſhould be killed, but would have them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: but this ſpark laſteth not long, but <note place="margin">The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituell life in man is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dead.</note> by and by Devilliſh wrath, and the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of revenge extinguiſheth it. From which it is underſtood that a ſpirituall life conſiſting in love and truth, in a carnall
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:65322:210"/> man is altogether dead, neither doth hee think otherwiſe, howſoever ſometimes by the light of nature they underſtand that there is a God, and that he doth governe humane affaires, yet by and by being blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the darkneſſe of heart, they call in <note place="margin">The mortall blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of man.</note> queſtion his providence, as their books doe witneſſe. And from this naturall blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and in-born miſts, ariſeth increduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, unſtedfaſtneſſe, and wavering-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which all men naturally are inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unto; and for which before Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God they are abomination, becauſe they live not in faith, and they doe not truſt from their heart. For ſeeing that a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man of the ſpirituall life and works of the ſame, is altogether ignorant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, hereon it is, that hee calleth not on God, but truſteth in his wiſdome, power and ſtrength, then which nothing can bee thought more fooliſh. Of the ſame blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the fruit is contempt of God, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſecurity. For as the Devill ſecure of God, careth not to humble himſelfe before him, but perſevereth in his pride; ſo hee <note place="margin">The ſeed of the Devill in man.</note> doth infect the ſoule of man by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God, with ſecurity, and inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:65322:211"/> ſo that he doth not humble himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; but ſecure of the divine fear, doth all things after his own will and mind, proudly, inſolently. As the Devill carried along with his own ſtrength and wiſdome, governeth himſelfe: ſo the ſoule of man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the contagion of the Devill, is wiſe unto it ſelfe, doth counſell and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern it ſelfe. As the Devill ſeekes his own honour onely: ſo the man hath no care of the divine honour, but onely his own. As the Devil hath contended with God; ſo hath hee armed the ſoule of man againſt God by impenitence. As the Devill doth blaſpheme the name of God, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ungratefull towards his Creator, as he is unmerciful, wrathfull, and bloudy; ſo he hath infected man with theſe vices, as with a peſtilent poyſon. As the Devil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth to exerciſe tyranny againſt man, and ſtirreth up one againſt another; ſo man by his diſcipline depraved, inſolently carrieth himſelfe over his neighbour, and deſpiſeth him as a man of no account, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rideth him as a foole, and abhorreth him as a man covered with greateſt ſinnes and outrages. As the Devill is an homicide; ſo
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:65322:211"/> he ſtirreth up the ſoule to the ſame cruelty and thirſt of humane bloud. Laſtly, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thy ſelfe aſſuredly, that God doth not accuſe the outward members, but the <note place="margin">God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth the ſoul alwayes.</note> heart and ſoule alwayes: for the heart and ſoule is an homicide, and a lier, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Hee that underſtandeth not this, he truly remaineth as a Mole-warp in the Scripture, neither underſtandeth the nature of originall ſinne, of repentance, of the new birth; laſtly, not any Article of Religion. We ſee daily before our eyes, the extream malice of men, their horrible pride, cruelty, hatred, and beaſtly envie: ſo that they are accuſtomed to lie in wait for another mans life with the hazard of their own, and deſire to have their neighbour utterly overthrown. Which inhumane and deteſtable envie, wrath, and rancor of minds, what other thing is it then that ſeed <note place="margin">The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony in the ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</note> and image of the Devil, of which wee ſpeak? God had planted in man in the ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, a pure, chaſt, and honeſt conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall affection, that he might beget children
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:65322:212"/> after the image of God according to the ſpirit; neither could there bee imagined a more holy pleaſure or love, then to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the image of God, and to multiply humane kind to the glory of God, and good of men. So, I ſay, if men in the ſtate of innocency could beget infinite chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and could propagate the honour of God and his image in infinite generations, for the great love both of God and man as the image of God, nothing more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nothing more pleaſant, and nothing would be more to be deſired. For even as God in the creation of man, did receive an ineffable pleaſure, and had in him (or took in him) delight as his image; ſo the man was to receive and have moſt pure pleaſure in the procreation of his life, and ſending forth of the divine Image, which at this day is the reaſon of marriages; and how Satan hath ſpotted and defiled that <note place="margin">The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</note> moſt pure and chaſt matrimoniall love with his filthineſſe, it is as evident as the noon-day. Therefore they mix together no otherwiſe then brute beaſts, and in a blind and furious heat doe beget like unto themſelves. Moreover, as the Devill is a
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:65322:212"/> Thiefe and a Robber, ſo hee infuſeth the ſame guile and art in the ſoule of man. As the Devil is a calumniator, a Sophiſter, a Sycophant, and a Scoffer of God and man, depraving both deeds and words, and wreſting the ſenſe, and repugning it with falſe interpretation, (of which craft hee ſhewed us a faire example, when hee ſudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced our firſt parents) ſo the minds of men corrupted with his peſtilent contagion, did contract a perverſe nature, lying, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning intrapping, and calumniating. Which Diabolicall and Satanicall corruption of the ſoule, inexpreſſible both in the craft and variety of it ſelfe, the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth under the perſon of a double tongued lying man, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. and bleſſed <hi>James, chap.</hi> 7. For God (as wee ſaid even now) doth not accuſe the mouth onely, the tongue, hands and feet, but the whole Man in his own law, yea, his heart and mind, as the cauſe and fountain of all evill, as appeareth by the two laſt precepts of the Decalogue concerning concupiſcence to be avoyded. Which is well to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <note place="margin">The I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Devill.</note> with ſpecial regard. And this is that image of the Devil ſet by his Father againſt
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:65322:213"/> the divine image, as luſt and pleaſure in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſlandering and reproaching, ſo farre forth as many that deſire to be accounted good Chriſtians, take occaſion of tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their neighbour; which happily being done, they ſay, applauding themſelves; I did this lately, now I have enough, I am freed of a great burden; I ſeeme to my ſelfe to returne, as it were, to life again, when at length I have ſatisfied my mind. What blindneſſe is this of yours, and unhappineſſe, O mortals, even not to know by whoſe inſtinct you doe theſe things? whoſe ſonnes you are? whoſe image you beare about? or doe you doubt that theſe workes are of the Devill, the work-maſter, theſe fruits to be of the ſeed of the Devil, theſe properties to bee from the nature of the Devil, which hee hath planted in our nature, that hee might riot by a plentiful increaſe in vices of all kinds, as pride, covetouſneſſe, luſt and ſlanders, of which wee ſpake erewhile? And this corruption of the Satanicall image, or originall ſin, is ſo filthy, horrible, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, as no man can in thought, much leſs in ſpeech expreſſe the abomination of your
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:65322:213"/> hearts. Which notwithſtanding no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, no Angell, I ſay, nor men, can either amend, or purge, or root out. For ſeeing our ſtrength and powers are utterly worne <note place="margin">No crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture can extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate ſin.</note> out, conſumed, and ſpiritually dead, it is a vain thing to expect any thing from them. Therefore this remaineth, that we bee mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and unhappy to all eternity, or uſe the counſell or help of ſome moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull avenger and extirper of ſinnes, Lord of evill and death, and which can by himſelfe change, renew, and purge hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature. Whereby it appeareth in the firſt place, that juſtification can be obtained by no humane good work, as alſo the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of regeneration is to bee found out. <note place="margin">The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural power of man.</note> And to ſpeak this again, the ſoul can by its own power or ſtrength do nothing but live in its in-born pravity, malice, and all kind of fins both againſt the precepts of God, and moſt eſpecially againſt the firſt Table, in tranſgreſſing whereof conſiſteth the true enmity with God; in our underſtanding &amp; will we are ſo blind, corrupt and dead, that it is againſt nature to feare God, love, call <note place="margin">The true explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of free-wil.</note> on him, honour, praiſe, worſhip, truſt in him, and to convert our ſoules to him. As
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:65322:214"/> concerning the ſecond Table, truly I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that there is in the ſoule a ſpark of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will remaining, yet very weak and without ſinewes, which therewithall it is hardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to retain and bridle the evill concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcences, that they break not forth into out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward works (to which things the example of the virtuous Ethnicks are extant in their virtue;) but to change the heart, to turn it to God, to purge it from wicked concupiſcences, is a greater work, onely a work of divine ſtrength. For the inward roots and fangs of evill are moſt deeply faſtened, ſo as all the endeavours of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will cannot perform to forbeare to breake out openly into flames to deſtroy all, but liveth in ſmoak and aſhes. Therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God, this humane kind could not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, the will of man is ſo depraved; and howſoever the Devil can do nothing more to exerciſe the greateſt cruelty in the mind of man, yet he cannot extirpate all naturall ſtrength and affections, whereby wee know the law of nature, and in-bred affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of married couples parents and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which are foundations and bands of humane ſociety. For hee that will doe all
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:65322:214"/> things to which hee is carried by the force of corrupt nature, it muſt needs bee that <note place="margin">Why naturall love is left in man.</note> he ſhall diſturb humane ſociety, and find out a revenging ſword of revenging pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Moreover, it muſt bee thought a deed done by the ſingular counſell of God, that this naturall affection was not utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, that we might underſtand the love of God was the ſoveraigne good, and the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God which we loſt by our fall and vice. But that which pertaineth to ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all good, concerning bleſſedneſſe, and the Kingdome of God, is as true as truth it ſelfe; bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <hi>The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man underſtandeth not the things that are of the ſpirit of God, for it is fooliſhneſſe to him, and be cannot underſtand it:</hi> that is, he hath not the leaſt ſpark of the ſpirituall light, taſting nothing of thoſe things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to an heavenly, divine, and ſpirituall life, to which man onely was created, that being enlightned with ſpirituall light by the inward eyes of the ſoul; he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the preſence of God, and his moſt ſincere love towards him, might live with <note place="margin">Man was born to a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life</note> him, and depend on his beck and call throughout all his life. And of this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:65322:215"/> light in the Kingdome of heaven, the naturall man hath not the leaſt ſpark, and he muſt needs abide in this hereditary and in-bred blindneſſe, unleſſe hee bee divinely <note place="margin">Naturall blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> enlightned. To which I would to God that naturall blindneſſe did not adjoyn it ſelfe, nor that the perverſity of man were <note place="margin">Man is nothing without Chriſt.</note> ſo great, as to put out that ſmall light of nature, whereby morall vertues, and externall honeſty of life is governed. <note place="margin">There is great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity in the ſons of God.</note> Which when it cometh to paſſe, then truly all the ſoul is blind, and cannot be ſet free from ſuch great blindneſſe, unleſſe it be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by Chriſt, regenerated by his ſpirit, renewed after the Image of God, and be made a new creature; or to ſpeak more truly, in this fraile life it onely beginne to be. For if every one of us that are in the new creature by the holy Ghoſt, doe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it will appeare in truth, that the Image of God is lightly ingraven in us, or rather ſhadowed onely, faith, hope, charity, and the feare of God, theſe are onely in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; little humility, but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, diffidency, pride and impatience, much greater; prayer weak and faint, and cold, and love to our neighbour as weak.
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:65322:215"/> Moreover, very ſmall ſparkes of ſpiriri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall chaſtity, on the contrary, flames of carnall pleaſures, as alſo ſelfe-love, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of private profit and honour, and the heat of concupiſcence will bee found in our hearts. Whereupon it followeth, that to <note place="margin">Inward ſtrife.</note> the laſt gaſp of our life, we are to fight and wraſtle with old <hi>Adam,</hi> and the image of the Devil by the ſpirit of God, neither ought we to have a greater care, and to lay it to heart, then to pray, mourn, ſigh, to ask, to ſeek, and knock, that the holy Ghoſt may be given us, who as our Captain may daily aboliſh in us the image of the Devil, and alſo renew us after the Image of God. Whereby we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that we are not to truſt to our ſelves, but to the divine grace, and that is it which doth all things in us, all things are to bee ſought, deſired, and intreated for of Chriſt by faith: Divine knowledge and wiſdome againſt our blindneſſe, the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt againſt all our ſins; Chriſt his ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification againſt our impurity, Chriſt his redemption, virtue, victory and fortitude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">The uſe of this chapter.</note> Death, Hell, and the Devill; pardon of all ſins againſt the kingdom of ſin &amp; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hings, rather two Chapters. The firſt is,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:65322:216"/> that through all this book, is by penitence, with all his fruits, as by renovation in Chriſt, by mortification of the fleſh, deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of our ſelves, contempt of the world, and exerciſe of charity, ſo copiouſly and dive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſly deſcribed, that was not without cauſe, nor raſhly done by me. For, firſt of all, repentance is the beginning and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation <note place="margin">Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</note> of Chriſtianity, of a holy life, and our bleſſedneſſe through faith: ſecondly, true and ſolid conſolation in the mind of man, cannot be felt to effect by him, that doth not not exactly underſtand the nature of originall ſinne, (never to bee ſufficiently deplored) fruits, and what kind of horrible, peſtilent, deadly, and diabolicall poyſon and ſeed it is; when we have ſtudied what we can, which unleſſe it be done, and a man before all things doe well know his owne miſeries, and ſo the terrible corruption of our originall ſin, in vain and of no account are all the books of ſpirituall and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall conſolation; whereby it is given to underſtand, how prepoſterous and choyce our nature is, and how it rejoyceth in flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, becauſe moſt men about this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and the fore-cited things of our
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:65322:217"/> ſins, of our in-bred corruption, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born wickedneſſe, wee onely pleaſe our ſelves. Which way of reaſoning the holy Scripture is juſt contrary, whoſe ſaying is, that a medicine is to bee prepared for the ſick, and not for the ſound and healthy; ſeeing that Chriſt is the true Phyſitian al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together <note place="margin">unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> of our ſouls, yet the crown of his merit with all vulgar conſolations, is of no worth nor uſe, where the knowledgement of the diſeaſe went not before; ſo the whole Chriſtian life is nothing elſe but a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall <note place="margin">A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life</note> and daily crucifying and mortifying of the fleſh. Neither can any man (this to be ſaid again and again) belong to Chriſt, who compoſeth himſelfe and his life o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: but thoſe that are ſo, thoſe are never Orphans, and without ſincere joy; nor laſtly, without celeſtial comfort and conſolation. Seeing this which wee ſpeak of, our proper miſery, the knowledge of our corruption and infirmity by the holy Ghoſt, and meditation of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Goſpel, doth bring forth moſt true conſolation of it ſelfe and the own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bringeth us to Chriſt; which ſeeing it is ſo, to bee adviſed by mee, Let no man
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:65322:217"/> of corrupt judgement deceive thee and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thee that theſe bookes are of little regard: Perſwade thy ſelf theſe are a blind <note place="margin">Fooliſh iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this book.</note> kind of men, and that with the moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of men they take knowledge of the miſery of their nature, both what <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt is, &amp; how <hi>Adam</hi> is to die in us, and how Chriſt ought to live in us; let not this be held for a dream, underſtand it not ſo. And whoſoever diſdaineth this notice, it is certaine that he hath his mind ſtuffed with the darkneſſe of ignorance; neither doth he underſtand what repentance, what faith, what new birth, what regeneration is, and in what chapters the whole courſe of living Chriſtianty is contained. And this is the firſt I deſire thee my Reader. And the ſecond, that thou be mindfull of ſpirituall pride: After that Almighty God <note place="margin">Three ſorts of ſpiritual pride.</note> ſhal begin by his grace to work in thee ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall gifts, new virtues, and new know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in thee, aſcribe none of theſe to thine own ſtrength, but wholly to divine grace; even the beginning of a holy life is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe before God, and ſo to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and it is as ſure, that all that thou doſt, is unperfect, lame, and defective.
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:65322:218"/> Moreover, that thou beware of the Devils Cobwebs, and his devices, whoſe properties and cuſtome is to ſow Popple amongſt the Wheat, to whom therefore thou art not to give place; but how much more is in the new gifts, the more do thou beware thou abuſe it not to thine honour, but in humble fear of God, aſcribe whatſoever it be, to the great and eternal author of them; <note place="margin">Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſpiritual pride.</note> and to thy ſelfe on the contrary, thou ſhalt deny all things, leſt perhaps thou mayſt ſay ſometimes in thine heart, O great faith of mine, great knowledge, great gifts: for leſt thou deceive thy ſelfe, none of theſe are thine, but Gods, without whoſe illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thou remaineſt a dead, filthy, and vile ſheafe. Therefore theſe gifts are none of thine, no more then the gliſtering of a gem or pretious ſtone wherein as a Jeweller hee putteth his treaſure: ſo God placeth in thee his goods, but without them thou art empty and void. And it were great dotage and foolery, to take occaſion to boaſt thy ſelf of another mans goods, as I ſhall ſpeak more in the ſecond book. For even as a Jeweller when as ſo oft as he pleaſeth, hath power to put his treaſure or Jewels into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:65322:218"/> box to carry where hee pleaſes, or keep about him: ſo God every moment may take his gifts from thee, whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou oughtſt to feare, and with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence eſchew ſpiritual arrogancy. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, thou muſt think that Almighty God will require an exact account of thoſe things of thee. And how great ſoever thoſe things be which our heavenly Father hath lent thee through Chriſt, they are onely beginnings and firſt fruits of ſolid graces. Furthermore, it is thy part to know, that there is no perfect gifts obtained but by prayer from God; without which what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they be that thou haſt, thoſe truly are but ſhadowes and unprofitable dead ſeeds, bearing no ripe fruits, as thou mayſt underſtand by my little book of prayers, <note place="margin">No pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable gifts are obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prayer.</note> whereby examples we teach, that without prayer no heavenly gifts doe deſcend into the heart of man. Of which little book, that thou mayſt have ſome taſte, I invite thee to read thoſe things which I have written in the ſecond booke of prayers. There be two things in ſpeciall which all our prayers ought to reſpect, one is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Devils image, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:65322:219"/> in power of incredulity, pride, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, luſt, wrath, and ſuch like. The other is, the reſtauration of the divine I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, in which is contained faith, hope, charity, humility, patience, lowlineſſe, the fear of the Lord: which two things are by <note place="margin">The ſum of the Lords prayer.</note> divine workmanſhip briefly contracted in the Lords prayer, as I may ſo ſay, that it maketh part for us, and part againſt us. For if the power of God be to be ſanctified, then it behoveth thee to kill thine owne power, with all the pride of old <hi>Adam.</hi> If th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> kingdome of God be to be built in thee, the Devils muſt be overthrown: if the will of God be to be fulfilled in thee, thine muſt needs be contemned and denied. And theſe two heads in the book of prayer are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if thou wilt have it profitable unto thee, are ſhadowed, as I ſaid even now, in the Lords Prayer, which is a certain brevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of heavenly and temporall gifts; which becauſe the Son of God commanded us to pray, therefore thoſe things his heavenly Father will give us much more willingly, it is more ſure then needs be called in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or any doubt made thereof. Of which in another place.</p>
